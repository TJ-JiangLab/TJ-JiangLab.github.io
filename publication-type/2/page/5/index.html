      <div class="article-style">
        
          Neuroectoderm is an important neural precursor. However, chromatin remodeling and its epigenetic regulatory roles during the differentiation of human neuroectodermal cells (hNECs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) remain largely unexplored. Here, we obtained hNECs through directed differentiation from hESCs, and determined chromatin states in the two cell types. Upon differentiation, H2A.Z-mediated nucleosome depletion leads to an open chromatin structure in promoters and upregulates expression of neuroectodermal genes. Increase in H3K9ac signals and decrease in H3K27me3 signals in promoters result in an active chromatin state and activate neuroectodermal genes. Conversely, decrease in H3K9ac signals and increase in H3K27me3 signals in promoters repress pluripotency genes. Moreover, H3K9ac signals facilitate the pluripotency factor Sox2 binding to target sites unique to hNECs. Knockdown of the acetyltransferase Kat2b erases H3K9ac signals, disrupts Sox2 binding, and fails the differentiation. Our results demonstrate a hierarchy of epigenetic regulation of gene expression during the differentiation of hNECs from hESCs through chromatin remodeling.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2017.cell_research.fang_yujiang/" >Smad5 acts as an intracellular pH messenger and maintains bioenergetic homeostasis</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Both environmental cues and intracellular bioenergetic states profoundly affect intracellular pH (pHi). How a cell responds to pHi changes to maintain bioenergetic homeostasis remains elusive. Here we show that Smad5, a well-characterized downstream component of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling responds to pHi changes. Cold, basic or hypertonic conditions increase pHi, which in turn dissociates protons from the charged amino acid clusters within the MH1 domain of Smad5, prompting its relocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. On the other hand, heat, acidic or hypotonic conditions decrease pHi, blocking the nuclear export of Smad5, and thus causing its nuclear accumulation. Active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Smad5 induced by environmental changes and pHi fluctuation is independent of BMP signaling, carboxyl terminus phosphorylation and Smad4. In addition, ablation of Smad5 causes chronic and irreversible dysregulation of cellular bioenergetic homeostasis and disrupted normal neural developmental processes as identified in a differentiation model of human pluripotent stem cells. Importantly, these metabolic and developmental deficits in Smad5-deficient cells could be rescued only by cytoplasmic Smad5. Cytoplasmic Smad5 physically interacts with hexokinase 1 and accelerates glycolysis. Together, our findings indicate that Smad5 acts as a pHi messenger and maintains the bioenergetic homeostasis of cells by regulating cytoplasmic metabolic machinery.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          Chromatin remodeling plays a critical role in gene regulation and impacts many biological processes. However, little is known about the relationship between chromatin remodeling dynamics and in vivo cell lineage commitment. Here, we reveal the patterns of histone modification change and nucleosome positioning dynamics and their epigenetic regulatory roles during the in vivo glial differentiation in early Drosophila embryos. The genome-wide average H3K9ac signals in promoter regions are decreased in the glial cells compared to the neural progenitor cells. However, H3K9ac signals are increased in a group of genes that are up-regulated in glial cells and involved in gliogenesis. There occurs extensive nucleosome remodeling including shift, loss, and gain. Nucleosome depletion regions (NDRs) form in both promoters and enhancers. As a result, the associated genes are up-regulated. Intriguingly, NDRs form in two fashions: nucleosome shift and eviction. Moreover, the mode of NDR formation is independent of the original chromatin state of enhancers in the neural progenitor cells.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2016.scientific_reports.zhang_shiping/" >dFoxO promotes Wingless signaling in Drosophila</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that regulates a wide range of physiological functions, including embryogenesis, organ maintenance, cell proliferation and cell fate decision. Dysregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling has been implicated in various cancers, but its role in cell death has not yet been fully elucidated. Here we show that activation of Wg signaling induces cell death in Drosophila eyes and wings, which depends on dFoxO, a transcription factor known to be involved in cell death. In addition, dFoxO is required for ectopic and endogenous Wg signaling to regulate wing patterning. Moreover, dFoxO is necessary for activated Wg signaling-induced target genes expression. Furthermore, Arm is reciprocally required for dFoxO-induced cell death. Finally, dFoxO physically interacts with Arm both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we have characterized a previously unknown role of dFoxO in promoting Wg signaling, and that a dFoxO-Arm complex is likely involved in their mutual functions, e.g. cell death.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2016.scientific_reports.shi_jiejun/" >Distinct response of the hepatic transcriptome to Aflatoxin B-1 induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis and resistance in rats</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Aflatoxin is a natural potent carcinogen and a major cause of liver cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinogenesis remain largely unexplored. In this study, we profiled global gene expression in liver tissues of rats that developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) administration and those that were AFB(1)-resistant, as well as rats without AFB(1) exposure as a control. AFB(1) exposure resulted in extensive perturbation in gene expression with different functions in HCC and AFB(1) resistance (AR) samples. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HCC sample were enriched for cell proliferation, cell adhesion and vasculature development that largely contribute to carcinogenesis. Anti-apoptosis genes were up-regulated in HCC sample whereas apoptosis-induction genes were up-regulated in AR sample. AFB(1) exposure also caused extensive alteration in expression level of lncRNAs. Among all the 4511 annotated lncRNAs, half of them were highly expressed only in HCC sample and up-regulated a group of protein-coding genes with cancer-related functions: apoptosis regulation, DNA repair, and cell cycle. Intriguingly, these genes were down-regulated by lncRNAs highly expressed in AR sample. Collectively, apoptosis is the critical biological process for carcinogenesis in response to AFB(1) exposure through changes in expression level of both protein-coding and lncRNA genes.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2016.molecular_biosystems.li_hongwen/" >Genetic analysis of the clonal stability of Chinese hamster ovary cells for recombinant protein production</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are frequently used for the production of recombinant proteins for therapeutical applications. However, the recombinant protein expression level of CHO cells may reduce during long-term culture. The physiological changes related to the stability of expression were not well understood. In this study, we performed a series of genetic analysis on stable and unstable clonal derived populations. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a large number of differentially expressed genes (100) were identified in the unstable population between early and late generations, while only a few differentially expressed genes were found in the stable population, suggesting that the gene expression change is related to the instability of recombinant protein production. On the other hand, no significant differences were found in promoter methylation or gene copy numbers in the unstable population. Taken together, our data help better understand the molecular mechanism underlying the stability of recombinant protein production in CHO cells.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2016.cell_reports.chen_jun/" >Hierarchical Oct4 Binding in Concert with Primed Epigenetic Rearrangements during Somatic Cell Reprogramming</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          The core pluripotency factor Oct4 plays key roles in somatic cell reprogramming through transcriptional control. Here, we profile Oct4 occupancy, epigenetic changes, and gene expression in reprogramming. We find that Oct4 binds in a hierarchical manner to target sites with primed epigenetic modifications. Oct4 binding is temporally continuous and seldom switches between bound and unbound. Oct4 occupancy in most of promoters is maintained throughout the entire reprogramming process. In contrast, somatic cell-specific enhancers are silenced in the early and intermediate stages, whereas stem cell-specific enhancers are activated in the late stage in parallel with cell fate transition. Both epigenetic remodeling and Oct4 binding contribute to the hyperdynamic enhancer signature transitions. The hierarchical Oct4 bindings are associated with distinct functional themes at different stages. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive molecular roadmap of Oct4 binding in concert with epigenetic rearrangements and rich resources for future reprogramming studies.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2016.science_china-life_sciences.lu_ping/" >Integrated transcriptome analysis of human iPS cells derived from a fragile X syndrome patient during neuronal differentiation</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients carry the expansion of over 200 CGG repeats at the promoter of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1), leading to decreased or absent expression of its encoded fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). However, the global transcriptional alteration by FMRP deficiency has not been well characterized at single nucleotide resolution, i.e., RNA-seq. Here, we performed in-vitro neuronal differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that were derived from fibroblasts of a FXS patient (FXS-iPSC). We then performed RNA-seq and examined the transcriptional misregulation at each intermediate stage during in-vitro differentiation of FXS-iPSC into neurons. After thoroughly analyzing the transcriptomic data and integrating them with those from other platforms, we found up-regulation of many genes encoding TFs for neuronal differentiation (WNT1, BMP4, POU3F4, TFAP2C, and PAX3), down-regulation of potassium channels (KCNA1, KCNC3, KCNG2, KCNIP4, KCNJ3, KCNK9, and KCNT1) and altered temporal regulation of SHANK1 and NNAT in FXS-iPSC derived neurons, indicating impaired neuronal differentiation and function in FXS patients. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the FMRP deficiency in FXS patients has significant impact on the gene expression patterns during development, which will help to discover potential targeting candidates for the cure of FXS symptoms.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2016.cell.gao_hua/" >Multi-organ Site Metastatic Reactivation Mediated by Non-canonical Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 Signaling</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Genetic screening identifies the atypical tetraspanin TM4SF1 as a strong mediator of metastatic reactivation of breast cancer. Intriguingly, TM4SF1 couples the collagen receptor tyrosine kinase DDR1 to the cortical adaptor syntenin 2 and, hence, to PKC alpha. The latter kinase phosphorylates and activates JAK2, leading to the activation of STAT3. This non-canonical mechanism of signaling induces the expression of SOX2 and NANOG; sustains the manifestation of cancer stem cell traits; and drives metastatic reactivation in the lung, bone, and brain. Bioinformatic analyses and pathological studies corroborate the clinical relevance of these findings. We conclude that non-canonical DDR1 signaling enables breast cancer cells to exploit the ubiquitous interstitial matrix component collagen I to undergo metastatic reactivation in multiple target organs.
