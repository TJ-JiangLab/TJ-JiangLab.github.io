      <div class="article-style">
        
          Understanding the biological processes that determine the entry of three germ layers of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is a central question in developmental and stem cell biology. Here, we genetically engineered hPSCs with the germ layer reporter and inducible CRISPR/Cas9 knockout system, and a genome-scale screening was performed to define pathways restricting germ layer specification. Genes clustered in the key biological processes, including embryonic development, mRNA processing, metabolism, and epigenetic regulation, were centered in the governance of pluripotency and lineage development. Other than typical pluripotent transcription factors and signaling molecules, loss of function of mesendodermal specifiers resulted in advanced neuroectodermal differentiation, given their inter-germ layer antagonizing effect. Regarding the epigenetic superfamily, microRNAs enriched in hPSCs showed clear germ layer-targeting specificity. The cholesterol synthesis pathway maintained hPSCs via retardation of neuroectoderm specification. Thus, in this study, we identified a full landscape of genetic wiring and biological processes that control hPSC self-renewal and trilineage specification.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2021.frontiers_in_microbiology.zhao_yuemeng/" >Optimization of CRISPR/Cas System for Improving Genome Editing Efficiency in Plasmodium falciparum</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Studies of molecular mechanisms and related gene functions have long been restricted by limited genome editing technologies in malaria parasites. Recently, a simple and effective genome editing technology, the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) system, has greatly facilitated these studies in many organisms, including malaria parasites. However, due to the special genome feature of malaria parasites, the manipulation and gene editing efficacy of the CRISPR/Cas system in this pathogen need to be improved, particularly in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Herein, based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we developed an integrating strategy to generate a Cas9i system, which significantly shortened the time for generation of transgenic strains in P. falciparum. Moreover, with this Cas9i system, we have successfully achieved multiplexed genome editing (mutating or tagging) by a single-round transfection in P. falciparum. In addition, we for the first time adapted AsCpf1 (Acidaminococcus sp. Cpf1), an alternative to Cas9, into P. falciparum parasites and examined it for gene editing. These optimizations of the CRISPR/Cas system will further facilitate the mechanistic research of malaria parasites and contribute to eliminating malaria in the future.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2021.cell_death_disease.liu_wenju/" >Pyroptosis inhibition improves the symptom of acute myocardial infarction</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the leading cause of mortality worldwide, is a rapidly developing and irreversible disease. Therefore, proper prompt intervention at the early stage of AMI is crucial for its treatment. However, the molecular features in the early stage have not been clarified. Here, we constructed mouse AMI model and profiled transcriptomes and proteomes at the early stages of AMI progress. Immune system was extensively activated at 6-h AMI. Then, pyroptosis was activated at 24-h AMI. VX-765 treatment, a pyroptosis inhibitor, significantly reduced the infarct size and improved the function of cardiomyocytes. Besides, we identified that WIPI1, specifically expressed in heart, was significantly upregulated at 1 h after AMI. Moreover, WIPI1 expression is significantly higher in the peripheral blood of patients with AMI than healthy control. WIPI1 can serve as a potential early diagnostic biomarker for AMI. It likely decelerates AMI progress by activating autophagy pathways. These findings shed new light on gene expression dynamics in AMI progress, and present a potential early diagnostic marker and a candidate drug for clinical pre-treatment to prolong the optimal cure time.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2021.mbio.lu_binbin/" >The Architectural Factor HMGB1 Is Involved in Genome Organization in the Human Malaria Parasite Plasmodium falciparum.</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          The three-dimensional (3D) genome organization plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. In the unicellular malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the high-order chromosome organization has emerged as an important epigenetic pathway mediating gene expression, particularly for virulence genes, but the related architectural factors and underlying mechanism remain elusive. Herein, we have identified the high-mobility-group protein HMGB1 as a critical architectural factor for maintenance of genome organization in P. falciparum Genome-wide occupancy analysis (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]) shows that the HMGB1 protein is recruited mainly to centromeric regions likely via a DNA-binding-independent pathway. Chromosome conformation capture coupled with next-generation sequencing (Hi-C-seq) and 3D modeling analysis show that the loss of HMGB1 disrupts the integrity of centromere/telomere-based chromosome organization accompanied with diminished interaction frequency among centromere clusters. This triggers local chromatin alteration and dysregulated gene expression. Notably, the entire repertoire of the primary virulence genes (var) was completely silenced in the absence of P. falciparum HMGB1 (PfHMGB1). Furthermore, the disrupted nuclear organization was reconstituted by complementation of HMGB1, thereby rescuing the mutually exclusive expression of the var gene family. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the architectural factor HMGB1 is associated with gene expression via mediating the high-order structure of genome organization. This finding not only contributes better understanding of the epigenetic regulation of gene expression but may also provide novel targets for antimalarial strategies.IMPORTANCE Malaria remains a major public health and economic burden currently. The mutually exclusive expression of the virulence genes is associated with the pathogenesis and immune evasion of human malaria parasites in the host. The nuclear architecture provides a well-organized environment for differential gene expression in the nucleus, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we have identified the highly conserved high-mobility-group protein HMGB1 as a key architecture regulator involved in virulence gene expression by establishing high-order genome organization in the nucleus of P. falciparum Mechanistic investigation revealed that the specific interaction of HMGB1 and centromeres constructed the precisely organized nuclear architecture, which coordinated with local chromatin structure to control the singular expression of virulence genes. Hence, this protein appears to be a critical architectural regulator for the pathogenesis of malaria infection and may be a new target for the development of an intervention strategy against malaria.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2020.clinica_chimica_acta.song_ya-xiang/" >A retrospective analysis reveals a predictor of survival for the patient with paraquat intoxication</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Feasible and accurate predictors are urgently needed to evaluate the survival for patients with paraquat poisoning since the high mortality of paraquat poisoning always resulted in the loss of both life and money. Multiple predictors have been developed to predict prognosis of the patients with PQ poisoning, which however heavily depend on the time of admission to hospitals. Here we reported a feasible and accurate prognosis predictor for patients with paraquat poisoning that is independent of the time of admission to hospitals. Patients with paraquat poisoning were enrolled in this study according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, which were grouped into survivors and non-survivors based on the 90-days follow-up investigation. The concentration of paraquat in serum and urine, and the baseline clinical parameters associated with the injuries of the liver, kidney, and lung were evaluated to predict the survival of these patients by using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses. A total of 114 patients was included in this study with a survival rate of 54.4%. The median survival days of non-survivors were 6.0 (95%Cl: 4.0-7.8). A new predictor, namely paraquat concentration-associated multiorgan injury index (PCAMII), was established by integrating serum and urine paraquat concentration, serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, total and direct bilirubin, at different weighting coefficients, with the accuracy of about 90%. The model to predict the survival probability by PCAMII was established with good fitness (R-2 = 0.9325), providing the simulated survival rates comparable to the clinical data. PCAMII, which is independent of hospital admission time, is a feasible and accurate marker to predict the survival rate of patients with PQ poisoning.

          The oocyte cytoplasm can reprogram the somatic cell nucleus into a totipotent state, but with low efficiency. The spatiotemporal chromatin organization of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos remains elusive. Here, we examine higher order chromatin structures of mouse SCNT embryos using a low-input Hi-C method. We find that donor cell chromatin transforms to the metaphase state rapidly after SCNT along with the dissolution of typical 3D chromatin structure. Intriguingly, the genome undergoes a mitotic metaphase-like to meiosis metaphase II-like transition following activation. Subsequently, weak chromatin compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) emerge following metaphase exit. TADs are further removed until the 2-cell stage before being progressively reestablished. Obvious defects including stronger TAD boundaries, aberrant super-enhancer and promoter interactions are found in SCNT embryos. These defects are partially caused by inherited H3K9me3, and can be rescued by Kdm4d overexpression. These observations provide insight into chromatin architecture reorganization during SCNT embryo development. The organisation of chromatin in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos remains poorly understood. Here, the authors examine higher order chromatin structures of mouse SCNT embryos and provide insights into chromatin architecture reorganisation during SCNT embryo development.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2020.journal_of_genetics_and_genomics.bai_dandan/" >Genome transfer for the prevention of female infertility caused by maternal gene mutation</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Poor oocyte quality is associated with early embryo developmental arrest and infertility. Maternal gene plays crucial roles in the regulation of oocyte maturation, and its mutation is a common cause of female infertility. However, how to improve oocyte quality and develop effective therapy for maternal gene mutation remains elusive. Here, we use Zar1 as an example to assess the feasibility of genome transfer to cure maternal gene mutation-caused female infertility. We first discover that cytoplasmic deficiency primarily leads to Zar1-null embryo developmental arrest by disturbing maternal transcript degradation and minor zygotic genome activation (ZGA) during the maternal-zygotic transition. We next perform genome transfer at the oocyte (spindle transfer or polar body transfer) and zygote (early pronuclear transfer or late pronuclear transfer) stages to validate the feasibility of preventing Zar1 mutation-caused infertility. We finally demonstrate that genome transfer either at the oocyte or at the early pronuclear stage can support normal preimplantation embryo development and produce live offspring. Moreover, those pups grow to adulthood and show normal fertility. Therefore, our findings provide an effective basis of therapies for the treatment of female infertility caused by maternal gene mutation.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          Atg7, a critical component of autophagy machinery, is essential for counteracting hematopoietic aging. However, the non-autophagic role of Atg7 on hematopoietic cells remains fundamentally unclear. In this study, we found that loss of Atg7, but not Atg5, another autophagy-essential gene, in the hematopoietic system reduces CD11b myeloid cellularity including CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) and CD11b(+)Ly6G(-) populations in mouse bone marrow.Surprisingly, Atg7 deletion causes abnormally accumulated histone H3.1 to be overwhelmingly trapped in the cytoplasm in the CD11b(+)Ly6G(-), but not the CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) compartment. RNA profiling revealed extensively chaotic expression of the genes required in nucleosome assembly. Functional assays further indicated upregulated aging markers in the CD11b(+)Ly6G(-) population. Therefore, our study suggests that Atg7 is essential for maintaining proper nucleosome assembly and limiting aging in the bone marrow CD11b(+)Ly6G(-) population.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2020.mbio.fan_yanting/" >Rrp6 Regulates Heterochromatic Gene Silencing via ncRNA RUF6 Decay in Malaria Parasites</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          The heterochromatin environment plays a central role in silencing genes associated with the malaria parasite's development, survival in the host, and transmission to the mosquito vector. However, the underlying mechanism regulating the dynamic chromatin structure is not understood yet. Here, we have uncovered that Plasmodium falciparum Rrp6, an orthologue of eukaryotic RNA exosome-associated RNase, controls the silencing of heterochromatic genes. PfRrp6 knockdown disrupted the singular expression of the GC-rich ncRNA RUF6 family, a known critical regulator of virulence gene expression, through the stabilization of the nascent transcripts. Mechanistic investigation showed that the accumulation of the multiple RUF6 ncRNAs triggered local chromatin remodeling in situ, which activated their adjacent var genes. Strikingly, chromatin isolation by RNA purification analysis (ChIRP-seq) revealed that a remarkable RUF6 ncRNA had interacted with distal heterochromatin regions directly and stimulated a global derepression effect on heterochromatic genes, including all variant gene families and the sexual commitment-associated regulator ap2 g gene. Collectively, Rrp6 appears to conduct the epigenetic surveillance of heterochromatic gene expression through controlling RUF6 levels, thereby securing antigenic variation and sexual commitment of malaria parasites during the infection of the host.IMPORTANCE Malaria remains a major public health and economic burden. The heterochromatin environment controls the silencing of genes associated with the fate of malaria parasites. Previous studies have demonstrated that a group of GC-rich ncRNAs (RUF6) is associated with the mutually exclusive expression of var genes, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, through a series of genetic manipulation and genome-wide multiomics analysis, we have identified the plasmodial orthologue of RNA exosome-associated Rrp6 as an upstream regulator of RUF6 expression and revealed that the dysregulation of RUF6 upon Rrp6 knockdown triggered local chromatin alteration, thereby activating most heterochromatic genes via direct interaction of RUF6 and distal gene loci. This finding not only uncovered the indepth mechanism of RUF6-mediated regulation of heterochromatic genes but also identified Rrp6 as a novel regulator of gene expression in human malaria parasites, which provides a new target for developing intervention strategies against malaria.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          Aim: We aimed to identify differentially expressed Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and explore their functional roles in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Materials & methods: We identified dysregulated lncRNAs and investigated their prognostic values and potential functions using MiRTarget2, catRAPID omics and Bedtools/blast/Pearson analyses. Results: Among the 143 differentially expressed lncRNAs, TCONS_00483150 could be used to distinguish patients with SLE from healthy controls and those with rheumatoid arthritis and patients with active/stable SLE from healthy controls. TCONS_00483150 was significantly correlated with anti-Rib-P antibody positivity and low C3 levels; TCONS_00483150 dysregulation might contribute to the metabolism of RNA and proteins in SLE patients. Conclusion: Overall, our findings offer a transcriptome-wide overview of aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in patients with SLE and highlight TCONS_00483150 as a potential novel diagnostic biomarker.
