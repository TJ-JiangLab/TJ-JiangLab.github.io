      <div class="article-style">
        
          Extensive and accurate chromatin remodeling is essential during primordial germ cell (PGC) development for the perpetuation of genetic information across generations. Here, we report that distal cis-regulatory elements (CREs) marked by DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) show temporally restricted activities during mouse and human PGC development. Using DHS maps as proxy, we accurately locate the genome-wide binding sites of pluripotency transcription factors in mouse PGCs. Unexpectedly, we found that mouse female meiotic recombination hotspots can be captured by DHSs, and for the first time, we identified 12,211 recombination hotspots in mouse female PGCs. In contrast to that of meiotic female PGCs, the chromatin of mitotic-arrested male PGCs is permissive through nuclear transcription factor Y (NFY) binding in the distal regulatory regions. Furthermore, we examined the evolutionary pressure on PGC CREs, and comparative genomic analysis revealed that mouse and human PGC CREs are evolutionarily conserved and show strong conservation across the vertebrate tree outside the mammals. Therefore, our results reveal unique, temporally accessible chromatin configurations during mouse and human PGC development.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2018.nucleic_acids_research.fu_shaliu/" >Differential analysis of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications for predicting mouse developmental enhancers</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Enhancers are distal cis-regulatory elements that modulate gene expression. They are depleted of nucleosomes and enriched in specific histone modifications; thus, calling DNase-seq and histone mark ChIP-seq peaks can predict enhancers. We evaluated nine peak-calling algorithms for predicting enhancers validated by transgenic mouse assays. DNase and H3K27ac peaks were consistently more predictive than H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K9ac peaks. DFilter and Hotspot2 were the best DNase peak callers, while HOMER, MUSIC, MACS2, DFilter and F-seq were the best H3K27ac peak callers. We observed that the differential DNase or H3K27ac signals between two distant tissues increased the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) of DNase peaks by 17.5-166.7% and that of H3K27ac peaks by 7.1-22.2%. We further improved this differential signal method using multiple contrast tissues. Evaluated using a blind test, the differential H3K27ac signal method substantially improved PR-AUC from 0.48 to 0.75 for predicting heart enhancers. We further validated our approach using postnatal retina and cerebral cortex enhancers identified by massively parallel reporter assays, and observed improvements for both tissues. In summary, we compared nine peak callers and devised a superior method for predicting tissue-specific mouse developmental enhancers by reranking the called peaks.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2018.cell_death_disease.hu_jian/" >Dynamic placement of the linker histone H1 associated with nucleosome arrangement and gene transcription in early Drosophila embryonic development</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          The linker histone H1 is critical to maintenance of higher-order chromatin structures and to gene expression regulation. However, H1 dynamics and its functions in embryonic development remain unresolved. Here, we profiled gene expression, nucleosome positions, and H1 locations in early Drosophila embryos. The results show that H1 binding is positively correlated with the stability of beads-on-a-string nucleosome organization likely through stabilizing nucleosome positioning and maintaining nucleosome spacing. Strikingly, nucleosomes with H1 placement deviating to the left or the right relative to the dyad shift to the left or the right, respectively, during early Drosophila embryonic development. H1 occupancy on genic nucleosomes is inversely correlated with nucleosome distance to the transcription start sites. This inverse correlation reduces as gene transcription levels decrease. Additionally, H1 occupancy is lower at the 5' border of genic nucleosomes than that at the 3' border. This asymmetrical pattern of H1 occupancy on genic nucleosomes diminishes as gene transcription levels decrease. These findings shed new lights into how H1 placement dynamics correlates with nucleosome positioning and gene transcription during early Drosophila embryonic development.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2018.cell_death_disease.ping_wangfang/" >Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis reveals that mouse chemical iPSCs have closer epigenetic features to mESCs than OSKM-integrated iPSCs</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Induced pluripotent stem cells can be derived from somatic cells through ectopic expression of transcription factors or chemical cocktails. Chemical iPSCs (C-iPSCs) and OSKM-iPSCs (4F-iPSCs) have been suggested to have similar characteristics to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, their epigenetic equivalence remains incompletely understood throughout the genome. In this study, we have generated mouse C-iPSCs and 4F-iPSCs, and further compared the genome-wide DNA methylomes of C-iPSCs, 4F-iPSCs, and mESCs that were maintained in 2i and LIF. Three pluripotent stem cells tend to be low methylated overall, however, DNA methylations in some specific regions (such as retrotransposons) are cell type-specific. Importantly, C-iPSCs are more hypomethylated than 4F-iPSCs. Bisulfite sequencing indicated that DNA methylation status in several known imprinted clusters, such as: Dlk1-Dio3 and Peg12-Ube3a, in C-iPSCs are closer to those of mESCs than 4F-iPSCs. Overall, our data demonstrate the reprogramming methods-dependent epigenetic differences of C-iPSCs and 4F-iPSCs and reveal that C-iPSCs are more hypomethylated than OSKM-integrated iPSCs.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2018.stem_cell_reports.he_wenteng/" >Reduced Self-Diploidization and Improved Survival of Semi-cloned Mice Produced from Androgenetic Haploid Embryonic Stem Cells through Overexpression of Dnmt3b</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells (AG-haESCs) hold great promise for exploring gene functions and generating gene-edited semi-cloned (SC) mice. However, the high incidence of self-diploidization and low efficiency of SC mouse production are major obstacles preventing widespread use of these cells. Moreover, although SC mice generation could be greatly improved by knocking out the differentially methylated regions of two imprinted genes, 50% of the SC mice did not survive into adulthood. Here, we found that the genome-wide DNA methylation level in AG-haESCs is extremely low. Subsequently, downregulation of both de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3b and other methylation-related genes was determined to be responsible for DNA hypomethylation. We further demonstrated that ectopic expression of Dnmt3b in AG-haESCs could effectively improve DNA methylation level, and the high incidence of self-diploidization could be markedly rescued. More importantly, the developmental potential of SC embryos was improved, and most SC mice could survive into adulthood.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2018.nucleic_acids_research.zhu_fugui/" >Sin3a-Tet1 interaction activates gene transcription and is required for embryonic stem cell pluripotency</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Sin3a is a core component of histone-deacetylation-activity-associated transcriptional repressor complex, playing important roles in early embryo development. Here, we reported that down-regulation of Sin3a led to the loss of embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and skewed differentiation into mesendoderm lineage. We found that Sin3a functioned as a transcriptional coactivator of the critical Nodal antagonist Lefty1 through interacting with Tet1 to de-methylate the Lefty1 promoter. Further studies showed that two amino acid residues (Phe147, Phe182) in the PAH1 domain of Sin3a are essential for Sin3a-Tet1 interaction and its activity in regulating pluripotency. Furthermore, genome-wide analyses of Sin3a, Tet1 and Pol II ChIP-seq and of 5mC MeDIP-seq revealed that Sin3a acted with Tet1 to facilitate the transcription of a set of their co-target genes. These results link Sin3a to epigenetic DNA modifications in transcriptional activation and have implications for understanding mechanisms underlying versatile functions of Sin3a in mouse ESCs.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2018.cell_death_disease.zhang_qingquan/" >Temporal requirements for ISL1 in sympathetic neuron proliferation, differentiation, and diversification</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Malformations of the sympathetic nervous system have been associated with cardiovascular instability, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and neuroblastoma. A better understanding of the factors regulating sympathetic nervous system development is critical to the development of potential therapies. Here, we have uncovered a temporal requirement for the LIM homeodomain transcription factor ISL1 during sympathetic nervous system development by the analysis of two mutant mouse lines: an Isl1 hypomorphic line and mice with Isl1 ablated in neural crest lineages. During early development, ISL1 is required for sympathetic neuronal fate determination, differentiation, and repression of glial differentiation, although it is dispensable for initial noradrenergic differentiation. ISL1 also plays an essential role in sympathetic neuron proliferation by controlling cell cycle gene expression. During later development, ISL1 is required for axon growth and sympathetic neuron diversification by maintaining noradrenergic differentiation, but repressing cholinergic differentiation. RNA-seq analyses of sympathetic ganglia from Isl1 mutant and control embryos, together with ISL1 ChIP-seq analysis on sympathetic ganglia, demonstrated that ISL1 regulates directly or indirectly several distinct signaling pathways that orchestrate sympathetic neurogenesis. A number of genes implicated in neuroblastoma pathogenesis are direct downstream targets of ISL1. Our study revealed a temporal requirement for ISL1 in multiple aspects of sympathetic neuron development, and suggested Isl1 as a candidate gene for neuroblastoma.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2017.chinese_bulletin_of_life_sciences.jiang_cizhong/" >Chromatin remodeling and its epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in cell fate transition</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Chromatin remodeling is an important epigenetic regulatory mechanism, and takes part in controlling many biological processes. However, the pattern and the functions of chromatin remodeling in cell fate transition remain enigmatic. To address this issue, we studied chromatin remodeling in mouse somatic cell reprograming and the differentiation of human embryonic cells (ESC) into neuroectodermal cells (NEC), respectively, and achieved a series of progress. The results show that accurate nucleosome remodeling takes place and results in a chromatin structure in iPSC highly similar to that in ESC. The core pluripotency factor Oct4 plays pivotal roles in somatic reprograming. We depicted the molecular roadmap of dynamic Oct4 binding and key histone modification changes in the course of somatic reprograming, and revealed the functions of their interactions in gain and maintenance of pluripotency. In the process of human ESC differentiating to NEC, we found that nucleosome eviction occurs in the nucleosome depletion regions right upstream of transcription start sites and activates these NEC-related genes. Acetyltransferase KAT2B deposits H3K9ac signal to recruit the transcription factor Sox2 binding to the target sites specific in NEC and activate the target genes, therefore facilitating the differentiation of NEC. These findings greatly improve our understanding of chromatin remodeling in cell fate transition and its associated epigenetic regulatory roles.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2017.cell_death_and_differentiation.ye_youqiong/" >Chromatin remodeling during in vivo neural stem cells differentiating to neurons in early Drosophila embryos</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Neurons are a key component of the nervous system and differentiate from multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs). Chromatin remodeling has a critical role in the differentiation process. However, its in vivo epigenetic regulatory role remains unknown. We show here that nucleosome depletion regions (NDRs) form in both proximal promoters and distal enhancers during NSCs differentiating into neurons in the early Drosophila embryonic development. NDR formation in the regulatory regions involves nucleosome shift and eviction. Nucleosome occupancy in promoter NDRs is inversely proportional to the gene activity. Genes with promoter NDR formation during differentiation are enriched for functions related to neuron development and maturation. Active histone-modification signals (H3K4me3 and H3K9ac) in promoters are gained in neurons in two modes: de novo establishment to high levels or increase from the existing levels in NSCs. The gene sets corresponding to the two modes have different neuronrelated functions. Dynamic changes of H3K27ac and H3K9ac signals in enhancers and promoters synergistically repress genes associated with neural stem or progenitor cell-related pluripotency and upregulate genes associated with neuron projection morphogenesis, neuron differentiation, and so on. Our results offer new insights into chromatin remodeling during in vivo neuron development and lay a foundation for its epigenetic regulatory mechanism study of other lineage specification.

      <h2><a href="/publication/2017.applied_microbiology_and_biotechnology.chen_kaiming/" >Genetic analysis of heterogeneous sub-clones in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have been widely used for production of recombinant proteins and therapeutic antibodies. However, owing to the instability and heterogeneity of CHO cells, the development of stable and high-expression recombinant CHO cell lines is often time-consuming. To investigate the mechanisms associated with heterogeneity in protein productivity, we performed transcriptome analysis on the subclones derived from a stable parental CHO clone. Two high-expression subclones and one low-expression subclone were selected based on their similar genomic background and subjected to RNA-seq analysis. Over 100 differentially expressed genes were identified between the subclones with high and low productivity. The molecular functions of the differentially expressed genes were enriched for translational elongation, sterol biosynthetic process, and regulation of secretion. In addition, analyses of the two subclones with high protein expression levels identified over 300 differentially expressed genes involved in DNA metabolic processes, cellular macromolecule catabolic processes, cell cycle, protein catabolic processes, and RNA processing and transcription. A subset of the differentially expressed genes was overexpressed in CHO cells to identify their effects on protein production. Together, these results indicate that transcriptome variation can cause significant inter-cellular heterogeneity in CHO cells and a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying heterogeneity might help to improve the production of recombinant proteins by CHO cells.
