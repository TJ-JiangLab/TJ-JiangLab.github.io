However, accumulating evidence indicates that in vitro fertilization (IVF) is associated with a low pregnancy rate, placental defects, and metabolic diseases in offspring. Here, we find that IVF manipulation notably disrupts extraembryonic tissue-specific gene expression, and 334 epiblast (Epi)-specific genes and 24 Epi-specific transcription factors are abnormally expressed in extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) of IVF embryos at embryonic day 7.5. Combined histone modification analysis reveals that aberrant H3K4me3 modification at the Epi active promoters results in increased expression of these genes in ExE. Importantly, we demonstrate that knockdown of the H3K4me3-recruited regulator Kmt2e, which is highly expressed in IVF embryos, greatly improves the development of IVF embryos and reduces abnormal gene expression in ExE. Our study therefore identifies that abnormal H3K4me3 modification in extraembryonic tissue is a major cause of implantation failure and abnormal placental development of IVF embryos.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2211-1247			WOS:000799098900003	35508139

However, it remains unclear if m5C modification contributes to the dynamic regulation of the transcriptome during the developmental cycles of Plasmodium parasites. Here, we characterize the landscape of m5C mRNA modifications at single nucleotide resolution in the asexual replication stages and gametocyte sexual stages of rodent (Plasmodium yoelii) and human (Plasmodium falciparum) malaria parasites. While different representations of m5C-modified mRNAs are associated with the different stages, the abundance of the m5C marker is strikingly enhanced in the transcriptomes of gametocytes. Our results show that m5C modifications confer stability to the Plasmodium transcripts and that a Plasmodium ortholog of NSUN2 is a major mRNA m5C methyltransferase in malaria parasites. Upon knockout of P. yoelii nsun2 (pynsun2), marked reductions of m5C modification were observed in a panel of gametocytogenesisassociated transcripts. These reductions correlated with impaired gametocyte production in the knockout rodent malaria parasites. Restoration of the nsun2 gene in the knockout parasites rescued the gametocyte production phenotype as well as m5C modification of the gametocytogenesis-associated transcripts. Together with the mRNA m5C profiles for two species of Plasmodium, our findings demonstrate a major role for NSUN2-mediated m5C modifications in mRNA transcript stability and sexual differentiation in malaria parasites.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0027-8424	1091-6490		WOS:000766705700018	35210361

However, recent studies suggested that MEKi might cause irreversible defects that compromise the developmental potential of mESCs. Here, we demonstrated the deficient bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal in the chemically defined condition is one of the main causes for the impaired pluripotency. Mechanistically, activating the BMP signal pathway by BMP4 could safeguard the chromosomal integrity and proliferation capacity of mESCs through regulating downstream targets Ube2s and Chmp4b. More importantly, BMP4 promotes a distinct in vivo developmental potential and a long-term pluripotency preservation. Besides, the pluripotent improvements driven by BMP4 are superior to those by attenuating MEK suppression. Taken together, our study shows appropriate activation of BMP signal is essential for regulating functional pluripotency and reveals that BMP4 should be applied in the serum-free culture system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-800X	1674-8018		WOS:000754137400001	35147915

However, the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Using dexamethasone-induced FGR and protein restriction-influenced FGR mouse models, we observe learning and memory deficits in adult FGR offspring. FGR induces decreased hippocampal neurogenesis from the early post-natal period to adulthood by reducing the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs). We further find a persistent decrease of Tet1 expression in hippocampal NSCs of FGR mice. Mechanistically, Tet1 downregulation results in hypermethylation of the Dll3 and Notch1 promoters and inhibition of Notch signaling, leading to reduced NSC proliferation. Overexpression of Tet1 activates Notch signaling, offsets the decline in neurogenesis, and enhances learning and memory abilities in FGR offspring. Our data indicate that a long-term decrease in Tet1/Notch signaling in hippocampal NSCs contributes to impaired neurogenesis following FGR and could serve as potential targets for the intervention of FGR-related cognitive disorders.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2211-1247			WOS:000715939600005	34731622

Using scRNA-seq and stringent validations, we reveal here a developmental roadmap for human telencephalic neurons. Both dorsal and ventral telencephalic radial glial cells (RGs) differentiate into neurons via dividing intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs_div) and early postmitotic neuroblasts (eNBs). The transcription factor ASCL1 plays a key role in promoting fate transition from RGs to IPCs_div in both regions. RGs from the regionalized neuroectoderm show heterogeneity, with restricted glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic differentiation potencies. During neurogenesis, IPCs_div gradually exit the cell cycle and branch into sister eNBs to generate distinct neuronal subtypes. Our findings highlight a general RGs-IPCs_div-eNBs developmental scheme for human telencephalic progenitors and support that the major neuronal fates of human telencephalon are predetermined during dorsoventral regionalization with neuronal diversity being further shaped during neurogenesis and neural circuit integration.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0261-4189	1460-2075		WOS:000698578700001	34558085

Therefore, proper prompt intervention at the early stage of AMI is crucial for its treatment. However, the molecular features in the early stage have not been clarified. Here, we constructed mouse AMI model and profiled transcriptomes and proteomes at the early stages of AMI progress. Immune system was extensively activated at 6-h AMI. Then, pyroptosis was activated at 24-h AMI. VX-765 treatment, a pyroptosis inhibitor, significantly reduced the infarct size and improved the function of cardiomyocytes. Besides, we identified that WIPI1, specifically expressed in heart, was significantly upregulated at 1 h after AMI. Moreover, WIPI1 expression is significantly higher in the peripheral blood of patients with AMI than healthy control. WIPI1 can serve as a potential early diagnostic biomarker for AMI. It likely decelerates AMI progress by activating autophagy pathways. These findings shed new light on gene expression dynamics in AMI progress, and present a potential early diagnostic marker and a candidate drug for clinical pre-treatment to prolong the optimal cure time.									12	0	0	0	7	0	12			2041-4889			WOS:000696544400003	34531373

A transcriptional switch of the pfap2-g gene triggers sexual commitment, but how the complex multi-step process is precisely programed remains largely unknown. Here, by systematic functional screening of a panel of ApiAP2 transcription factors, we identify six new ApiAP2 members associated with gametocytogenesis in Plasmodium falciparum. Among these, PfAP2-G5 (PF3D7_1139300) was found to be indispensable for gametocytogenesis. This factor suppresses the transcriptional activity of the pfap2-g gene via binding to both the upstream region and exonic gene body, the latter is linked to the maintenance of local heterochromatin structure, thereby preventing initiation of sexual commitment. Removal of this repressive effect through pfap2-g5 knockout disrupts the asexual replication cycle and promotes sexual commitment accompanied by upregulation of pfap2-g expression. However, the gametocytes produced fail to mature fully. Further analyses show that PfAP2-G5 is essential for gametocyte maturation, and causes the down-regulation of pfap2-g and a set of early gametocyte genes activated by PfAP2-G prior to gametocyte development. Collectively, our findings reveal a regulation cascade of gametocyte production in malaria parasites, and provide a new target for transmission blocking interventions.									9	1	0	0	9	0	10			0305-1048	1362-4962		WOS:000701664900022	34365503

TSCs can be derived from trophoblast cells. However, the efficiency of TSC derivation from somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT) blastocysts is low. The regulatory mechanisms underlying transcription dynamics and epigenetic landscape remodeling during TSC derivation remain elusive. Here, we derived TSCs from the blastocysts by natural fertilization (NF), NT, and a histone deacetylase inhibitor Scriptaid-treated NT (SNT). Profiling of the transcriptomes across the stages of TSC derivation revealed that fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) treatment resulted in many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at outgrowth and initiated transcription program for TSC formation. We identified 75 transcription factors (TFs) that are continuously upregulated during NF TSC derivation, whose transcription profiles can infer the time course of NF not NT TSC derivation. Most DEGs in NT outgrowth are rescued in SNT outgrowth. The correct time course of SNT TSC derivation is inferred accordingly. Moreover, these TFs comprise an interaction network important to TSC stemness. Profiling of DNA methylation dynamics showed an extremely low level before FGF4 treatment and gradual increases afterward. FGF4 treatment results in a distinct DNA methylation remodeling process committed to TSC formation. We further identified 1,293 CpG islands (CGIs) whose DNA methylation difference is more than 0.25 during NF TSC derivation. The majority of these CGIs become highly methylated upon FGF4 treatment and remain in high levels. This may create a barrier for lineage commitment to restrict embryonic development, and ensure TSC formation. There exist hundreds of aberrantly methylated CGIs during NT TSC derivation, most of which are corrected during SNT TSC derivation. More than half of the aberrantly methylated CGIs before NT TSC formation are inherited from the donor genome. In contrast, the aberrantly methylated CGIs upon TSC formation are mainly from the highly methylated CGIs induced by FGF4 treatment. Functional annotation indicates that the aberrantly highly methylated CGIs play a role in repressing placenta development genes, etc., related to post-implantation development and maintaining TSC pluripotency. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the transcription dynamics, DNA methylation remodeling, and the role of FGF4 during TSC derivation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-634X			WOS:000640343300001	33869230

Here our analyses identify ALYREF, expressed from the most common genetic copy number variation in neuroblastoma, chromosome 17q21-ter gain as a key regulator of MYCN protein turnover. We show strong co-operativity between ALYREF and MYCN from transgenic models of neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo. The two proteins form a nuclear coactivator complex which stimulates transcription of the ubiquitin specific peptidase 3, USP3. We show that increased USP3 levels reduce K-48- and K-63-linked ubiquitination of MYCN, thus driving up MYCN protein stability. In the MYCN-ALYREF-USP3 signal, ALYREF is required for MYCN effects on the malignant phenotype and that of USP3 on MYCN stability. This data defines a MYCN oncoprotein dependency state which provides a rationale for future pharmacological studies. Neuroblastoma (NB) is often driven by MYCN amplification. Here, the authors show that the most frequent genetic lesion, gain of 17q21-ter in NB leads to overexpression of ALYREF, which forms a complex with MYCN, regulating MYCN stability via the deubiquitinating enzyme, USP3.									12	0	0	0	7	0	12			2041-1723			WOS:000637990400004	33767157

In this study, we first discovered that Leptin mutant rats (Lep(Delta I14/Delta I14)) exhibit characteristic NASH phenotypes including steatosis, lymphocyte infiltration, and ballooning after postnatal week 16. We then examined NASH progression by performing an integrated analysis of hepatic transcriptome in Leptin-deficient rats from postnatal 4 to 48 weeks. Initially, simple steatosis in Lep(Delta I14/Delta I14) rats were observed with increased expression of the genes encoding for rate-limiting enzymes in lipid metabolism such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. When NASH phenotypes became well developed at postnatal week 16, we found gene expression changes in insulin resistance, inflammation, reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum stress. As NASH phenotypes further progressed with age, we observed elevated expression of cytokines and chemokines including C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1 beta together with activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B pathways. Histologically, livers in Lep(Delta I14/Delta I14) rats exhibited increased cell infiltration of MPO+ neutrophils, CD8(+) T cells, CD68(+) hepatic macrophages, and CCR2(+) inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages associated with macrophage polarization from M2 to M1. Subsequent cross-species comparison of transcriptomes in human, rat, and mouse NASH models indicated that Leptin-deficient rats bear more similarities to human NASH patients than previously established mouse NASH models. Taken together, our study suggests that Lep(Delta I14/Delta I14) rats are a valuable pre-clinical rodent model to evaluate NASH drug safety and efficacy.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1535-3702	1535-3699		WOS:000628236400005	33302736

Here, we genetically engineered hPSCs with the germ layer reporter and inducible CRISPR/Cas9 knockout system, and a genome-scale screening was performed to define pathways restricting germ layer specification. Genes clustered in the key biological processes, including embryonic development, mRNA processing, metabolism, and epigenetic regulation, were centered in the governance of pluripotency and lineage development. Other than typical pluripotent transcription factors and signaling molecules, loss of function of mesendodermal specifiers resulted in advanced neuroectodermal differentiation, given their inter-germ layer antagonizing effect. Regarding the epigenetic superfamily, microRNAs enriched in hPSCs showed clear germ layer-targeting specificity. The cholesterol synthesis pathway maintained hPSCs via retardation of neuroectoderm specification. Thus, in this study, we identified a full landscape of genetic wiring and biological processes that control hPSC self-renewal and trilineage specification.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2589-0042		WOS:000612996900045	33385119

Recently, a simple and effective genome editing technology, the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) system, has greatly facilitated these studies in many organisms, including malaria parasites. However, due to the special genome feature of malaria parasites, the manipulation and gene editing efficacy of the CRISPR/Cas system in this pathogen need to be improved, particularly in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Herein, based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we developed an integrating strategy to generate a Cas9i system, which significantly shortened the time for generation of transgenic strains in P. falciparum. Moreover, with this Cas9i system, we have successfully achieved multiplexed genome editing (mutating or tagging) by a single-round transfection in P. falciparum. In addition, we for the first time adapted AsCpf1 (Acidaminococcus sp. Cpf1), an alternative to Cas9, into P. falciparum parasites and examined it for gene editing. These optimizations of the CRISPR/Cas system will further facilitate the mechanistic research of malaria parasites and contribute to eliminating malaria in the future.									6	0	0	0	5	1	6				1664-302X		WOS:000609257600001	33488567

The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) has been found to improve SCNT efficiency, but the underlying mechanism remains undetermined. Here, we examined genome-wide H3K9ac during SCNT embryo development and found that aberrant H3K9ac regions resulted in reduced 2-cell genome activation. TSA treatment largely corrects aberrant acetylation in SCNT embryos with an efficiency that is dictated by the native epigenetic environment. We further identified that the overexpression of Dux greatly improves SCNT efficiency by correcting the aberrant H3K9ac signal at its target sites, ensuring appropriate 2-cell genome activation. Intriguingly, the improvement in development mediated by TSA and Kdm4b is impeded by Dux knockout in SCNT embryos. Together, our study reveals that reprogramming of H3K9ac is important for optimal SCNT efficiency and identifies Dux as a crucial transcription factor in this process.									34	2	0	0	20	0	35			1934-5909	1875-9777		WOS:000606536600017	33049217

In the unicellular malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the high-order chromosome organization has emerged as an important epigenetic pathway mediating gene expression, particularly for virulence genes, but the related architectural factors and underlying mechanism remain elusive. Herein, we have identified the high-mobility-group protein HMGB1 as a critical architectural factor for maintenance of genome organization in P. falciparum Genome-wide occupancy analysis (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]) shows that the HMGB1 protein is recruited mainly to centromeric regions likely via a DNA-binding-independent pathway. Chromosome conformation capture coupled with next-generation sequencing (Hi-C-seq) and 3D modeling analysis show that the loss of HMGB1 disrupts the integrity of centromere/telomere-based chromosome organization accompanied with diminished interaction frequency among centromere clusters. This triggers local chromatin alteration and dysregulated gene expression. Notably, the entire repertoire of the primary virulence genes (var) was completely silenced in the absence of P. falciparum HMGB1 (PfHMGB1). Furthermore, the disrupted nuclear organization was reconstituted by complementation of HMGB1, thereby rescuing the mutually exclusive expression of the var gene family. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the architectural factor HMGB1 is associated with gene expression via mediating the high-order structure of genome organization. This finding not only contributes better understanding of the epigenetic regulation of gene expression but may also provide novel targets for antimalarial strategies.IMPORTANCE Malaria remains a major public health and economic burden currently. The mutually exclusive expression of the virulence genes is associated with the pathogenesis and immune evasion of human malaria parasites in the host. The nuclear architecture provides a well-organized environment for differential gene expression in the nucleus, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we have identified the highly conserved high-mobility-group protein HMGB1 as a key architecture regulator involved in virulence gene expression by establishing high-order genome organization in the nucleus of P. falciparum Mechanistic investigation revealed that the specific interaction of HMGB1 and centromeres constructed the precisely organized nuclear architecture, which coordinated with local chromatin structure to control the singular expression of virulence genes. Hence, this protein appears to be a critical architectural regulator for the pathogenesis of malaria infection and may be a new target for the development of an intervention strategy against malaria.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4				2150-7511		MEDLINE:33906919	33906919
