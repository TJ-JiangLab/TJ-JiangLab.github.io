Epigenomics											10.2217/epi-2019-0265				2020-Jul-17	2020	Aim: We aimed to identify differentially expressed Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and explore their functional roles in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Materials & methods: We identified dysregulated lncRNAs and investigated their prognostic values and potential functions using MiRTarget2, catRAPID omics and Bedtools/blast/Pearson analyses. Results: Among the 143 differentially expressed lncRNAs, TCONS_00483150 could be used to distinguish patients with SLE from healthy controls and those with rheumatoid arthritis and patients with active/stable SLE from healthy controls. TCONS_00483150 was significantly correlated with anti-Rib-P antibody positivity and low C3levels; TCONS_00483150 dysregulation might contribute to the metabolism of RNA and proteins in SLE patients. Conclusion: Overall, our findings offer a transcriptome-wide overview of aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in patients with SLE and highlight TCONS_00483150 as a potential novel diagnostic biomarker.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0		1750-192X		MEDLINE:32677847	32677847

However, the underlying mechanism regulating the dynamic chromatin structure is not understood yet. Here, we have uncovered that Plasmodium falciparum Rrp6, an orthologue of eukaryotic RNA exosome-associated RNase, controls the silencing of heterochromatic genes. PfRrp6 knockdown disrupted the singular expression of the GC-rich ncRNA RUF6 family, a known critical regulator of virulence gene expression, through the stabilization of the nascent transcripts. Mechanistic investigation showed that the accumulation of the multiple RUF6 ncRNAs triggered local chromatin remodeling in situ, which activated their adjacent var genes. Strikingly, chromatin isolation by RNA purification analysis (ChIRP-seq) revealed that a remarkable RUF6 ncRNA had interacted with distal heterochromatin regions directly and stimulated a global derepression effect on heterochromatic genes, including all variant gene families and the sexual commitment-associated regulator ap2-g gene. Collectively, Rrp6 appears to conduct the epigenetic surveillance of heterochromatic gene expression through controlling RUF6 levels, thereby securing antigenic variation and sexual commitment of malaria parasites during the infection of the host.IMPORTANCE Malaria remains a major public health and economic burden. The heterochromatin environment controls the silencing of genes associated with the fate of malaria parasites. Previous studies have demonstrated that a group of GC-rich ncRNAs (RUF6) is associated with the mutually exclusive expression of var genes, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, through a series of genetic manipulation and genome-wide multiomics analysis, we have identified the plasmodial orthologue of RNA exosome-associated Rrp6 as an upstream regulator of RUF6 expression and revealed that the dysregulation of RUF6 upon Rrp6 knockdown triggered local chromatin alteration, thereby activating most heterochromatic genes via direct interaction of RUF6 and distal gene loci. This finding not only uncovered the in-depth mechanism of RUF6-mediated regulation of heterochromatic genes but also identified Rrp6 as a novel regulator of gene expression in human malaria parasites, which provides a new target for developing intervention strategies against malaria.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1		2150-7511		MEDLINE:32487761	32487761

The spatiotemporal chromatin organization of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos remains elusive. Here, we examine higher order chromatin structures of mouse SCNT embryos using a low-input Hi-C method. We find that donor cell chromatin transforms to the metaphase state rapidly after SCNT along with the dissolution of typical 3D chromatin structure. Intriguingly, the genome undergoes a mitotic metaphase-like to meiosis metaphase II-like transition following activation. Subsequently, weak chromatin compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) emerge following metaphase exit. TADs are further removed until the 2-cell stage before being progressively reestablished. Obvious defects including stronger TAD boundaries, aberrant super-enhancer and promoter interactions are found in SCNT embryos. These defects are partially caused by inherited H3K9me3, and can be rescued by Kdm4d overexpression. These observations provide insight into chromatin architecture reorganization during SCNT embryo development. The organisation of chromatin in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos remains poorly understood. Here, the authors examine higher order chromatin structures of mouse SCNT embryos and provide insights into chromatin architecture reorganisation during SCNT embryo development.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2	2041-1723			WOS:000528789000003	32286279	
J	Liu, Meng; Lu, Binbin; Fan, Yanting; He, Xiaohui; Shen, Shijun; Jiang, Cizhong; Zhang, Qingfeng								TRIBE Uncovers the Role of Dis3 in Shaping the Dynamic Transcriptome in Malaria Parasites								FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY				7						264	10.3389/fcell.2019.00264				NOV 1 2019	2019	Identification of RNA targets of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is essential for complete understanding of their biological functions. However, it is still a challenge to identify the biologically relevant targets of RBPs through in vitro strategies of RIP-seq, HITS-CLIP, or GoldCLIP due to the potentially high background and complicated manipulation. In malaria parasites, RIP-seq and gene disruption are the few tools available currently for identification of RBP targets. Here, we have adopted the TRIBE (Targets of RNA binding proteins identified by editing) system to in vivo identify the RNA targets of PfDis3, a key exoribonuclease subunit of RNA exosome in Plasmodium falciparum. We generated a transgenic parasite line of PfDis3-ADARcd, which catalyzes an adenosine (A)-to-inosine (I) conversion at the potential interacting sites of PfDis3-targeting RNAs. Most of PfDis3 target genes contain one edit site. The majority of the edit sites detected by PfDis3-TRIBE locate in exons and spread across the entire coding regions. The nucleotides adjacent to the edit sites contain similar to 75% of A C T. PfDis3-TRIBE target genes are biases toward higher RIP enrichment, suggesting that PfDis3-TRIBE preferentially detects stronger PfDis3 RIP targets. Collectively, PfDis3-TRIBE is a favorable tool to identify in vivo target genes of RBP with high efficiency and reproducibility. Additionally, the PfDis3-targeting genes are involved in stage-related biological processes during the blood-stage development. Thus PfDis3 appears to shape the dynamic transcriptional transcriptome of malaria parasites through post-transcriptional degradation of a variety of unwanted transcripts from both strands in the asexual blood stage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	3	2296-634X			WOS:000513934100002	31737630

Here, using a novel reporter cassette for simultaneous detection of homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at the same chromosomal site, we report that the efficiency of HR but not NHEJ negatively correlates with nucleosome density. We demonstrate that PARP1 is required for HR by modulating nucleosome density at damage sites. Mechanistic studies indicate that the ATPase domain of BRG1 and the ZnF domain of SIRT1 interact with poly-ADP ribose (PAR) in response to DNA damage, and are responsible for bringing the two factors to broken DNA ends. At DNA damage sites, BRG1 and SIRT1 physically interact, whereupon SIRT1 deacety-lates BRG1 at lysine residues 1029 and 1033, stimulating its ATPase activity to remodel chromatin and promote HR.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4	4	7	0305-1048	1362-4962		WOS:000490576900023	31291457

Moreover, FACT and MYCN expression form a forward feedback loop in neuroblastoma. It is unclear whether MYCN is involved in chromatin remodeling in neuroblastoma through regulation of its target genes. We showed here that MYCN knockdown resulted in loss of the nucleosome-free regions through nucleosome assembly in the promoters of genes functionally enriched for DNA repair. The active mark H3K9ac was removed or replaced by the repressive mark H3K27me3 in the promoters of double-strand break repair-related genes upon MYCN knockdown. Such chromatin state alterations occurred only in MYCN-bound promoters. Consistently, MYCN knockdown resulted in a marked increase in DNA damage in the treatment with hydroxyurea. In contrast, nucleosome reorganization and histone modification changes in the enhancers largely included target genes with tumorigenesis-related functions such as cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell-cell adhesion. The chromatin state significantly changed in both MYCN-bound and MYCN-unbound enhancers upon MYCN knockdown. Furthermore, MYCN knockdown independently regulated chromatin remodeling in the promoters and the enhancers. These findings reveal the novel epigenetic regulatory role of MYCN in chromatin remodeling and provide an alternative potential epigenetic strategy for MYCN-driven neuroblastoma treatment.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1		1664-8021		WOS:000477011200001	31396265

The two sub-clones, with different expression levels (qp were 42.8pg/cell/day and 14.0pg/cell/day), were analyzed through RNA-seq. More than 600 genes were identified as differently expressed, and we found that the differentially expressed genes were involved in processes such as RNA processing, transcription, protein catabolism, and protein transport. Among these, we cloned genes encoding proteins that were involved in transcription and protein transport to investigate their effect on protein production.ConclusionsWe found that some genes involved in transcription and protein transport would improve recombinant protein production in CHO cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	6	0141-5492	1573-6776		WOS:000470279400008	31114947

However, the roles of chromatin remodeling in establishment and maintenance of cell identity during cell fate transition remain enigmatic. Here, we compared the changes in gene expression, as well as the dynamics of nucleosome positioning and key histone modifications between the four major neural cell types during Drosophila neural development. We find that the neural progenitors can be separated from the terminally differentiated cells based on their gene expression profiles, whereas nucleosome distribution in the flanking regions of transcription start sites fails to identify the relationships between the progenitors and the differentiated cells. H3K27me3 signal in promoters and enhancers can not only distinguish the progenitors from the differentiated cells but also identify the differentiation path of the neural stem cells (NSCs) to the intermediate progenitor cells to the glial cells. In contrast, H3K9ac signal fails to identify the differentiation path, although it activates distinct sets of genes with neuron-specific and glia-related functions during the differentiation of the NSCs into neurons and glia, respectively. Together, our study provides novel insights into the crucial roles of chromatin remodeling in determining cell type during Drosophila neural development.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	1672-0229	2210-3244		WOS:000490550300008	31195140

More than 90% of cancer patients died from tumor metastasis, instead of primary tumor growth. The canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway plays essential roles in promoting tumor formation, yet its function in regulating tumor metastasis and the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. Here we employed well-established Drosophila tumor models to investigate the regulating mechanism of Wingless (Wg) pathway in tumor invasion. Our results showed that Wg signaling is necessary and sufficient for cell polarity disruption-induced cell migration and molecular changes reminiscent of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, reducing Wg signaling suppressed lgl(-/-)/Ras(V12)-induced tumor invasion, and cooperation between Arm and Ras(V12) is sufficient to induce tumor invasion. Mechanistically, we found that cell polarity disruption activates JNK signaling, which in turn upregulate wg expression through transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1). We identified a consensus AP-1 binding site located in the 2nd intron of wg, and confirmed that it is essential for AP-1 induced wg transcription both in vitro and in vivo. Lastly, we confirmed that the transcriptional activation of WNT by AP-1 is conserved in human cancer cells. These evidences reveal a positive role of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in tumor invasion, and provide a conserved mechanism that connects JNK and Wnt signaling in regulating tumor progression.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6	5	15	0950-9232	1476-5594		WOS:000468035600008	30683884

Direct reprogramming of other adult cells into hepatic cells may offer a solution to this problem. In a previous study, we have generated hepatocyte-like cells from mouse fibroblasts using only one transcription factor (TF) plus a chemical cocktail. Here, we show that human urine-derived epithelial-like cells (hUCs) can also be transdifferentiated into human hepatocyte-like cells (hiHeps) using one TF (Foxa3, Hnf1 alpha, or Hnf4 alpha) plus the same chemical cocktail CRVPTD (C, CHIR99021; R, RepSox; V, VPA; P, Parnate; T, TTNPB; and D, Dznep). These hiHeps express multiple hepatocyte-specific genes and display functions characteristic of mature hepatocytes. With the introduction of the large T antigen, these hiHeps can be expanded in vitro and can restore liver function in mice with concanavalin-A-induced acute liver failure. Our study provides a strategy to generate functional hepatocyte-like cells from hUCs by using a single TF plus a chemical cocktail.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4	1	14	1671-4083	1745-7254		WOS:000466149400006	30315254

Yet, how methylation affects immune surveillance and tumor metastasis remains ambiguous. We introduce a novel method, Guide Positioning Sequencing (GPS), for precisely detecting whole-genome DNA methylation with cytosine coverage as high as 96% and unbiased coverage of GC-rich and repetitive regions. Systematic comparisons of GPS with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) found that methylation difference between gene body and promoter is an effective predictor of gene expression with a correlation coefficient of 0.67 (GPS) versus 0.33 (WGBS). Moreover, Methylation Boundary Shift (MBS) in promoters or enhancers is capable of modulating expression of genes associated with immunity and tumor metabolism. Furthermore, aberrant DNA methylation results in tissue-specific enhancer switching, which is responsible for altering cell identity during liver cancer development. Altogether, we demonstrate that GPS is a powerful tool with improved accuracy and efficiency over WGBS in simultaneously detecting genome-wide DNA methylation and genomic variation. Using GPS, we show that aberrant DNA methylation is associated with altering cell identity and immune surveillance networks, which may contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1	4	12	1088-9051	1549-5469		WOS:000457462100010	30670627

Expression of ISL1 has been associated with neuroblastoma, a pediatric tumor derived from sympatho-adrenal progenitors, however the role of ISL1 in neuroblastoma remains unexplored.Method: Here, we knocked down ISL1 (KD) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and performed RNA-seq and ISL1 ChIP-seq analyses.Results: Analyses of these data revealed that ISL1 acts upstream of multiple oncogenic genes and pathways essential for neuroblastoma proliferation and differentiation, including LMO1 and LIN28B. ISL1 promotes expression of a number of cell cycle associated genes, but represses differentiation associated genes including RA receptors and the downstream target genes EPAS1 and CDKN1A. Consequently, Knockdown of ISL1 inhibits neuroblastoma cell proliferation and migration in vitro and impedes tumor growth in vivo, and enhances neuronal differentiation by RA treatment. Furthermore, genome-wide mapping revealed a substantial co-occupancy of binding regions by ISL1 and GATA3, and ISL1 physically interacts with GATA3, and together they synergistically regulate the aforementioned oncogenic pathways. In addition, analyses of the roles of ISL1 and MYCN in MYCN-amplified and MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma cells revealed an epistatic relationship between ISL1 and MYCN. ISL1 and MYCN function in parallel to regulate common yet distinct oncogenic pathways in neuroblastoma.Conclusion: Our study has demonstrated that ISL1 plays an essential role in neuroblastoma regulatory networks and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in neuroblastoma.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2	1	4	1838-7640			WOS:000457199500006	30867811

They are depleted of nucleosomes and enriched in specific histone modifications; thus, calling DNase-seq and histone mark ChIP-seq peaks can predict enhancers. We evaluated nine peak-calling algorithms for predicting enhancers validated by transgenic mouse assays. DNase and H3K27ac peaks were consistently more predictive than H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K9ac peaks. DFilter and Hotspot2 were the best DNase peak callers, while HOMER, MUSIC, MACS2, DFilter and F-seq were the best H3K27ac peak callers. We observed that the differential DNase or H3K27ac signals between two distant tissues increased the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) of DNase peaks by 17.5-166.7% and that of H3K27ac peaks by 7.1-22.2%. We further improved this differential signal method using multiple contrast tissues. Evaluated using a blind test, the differential H3K27ac signal method substantially improved PR-AUC from 0.48 to 0.75 for predicting heart enhancers. We further validated our approach using postnatal retina and cerebral cortex enhancers identified by massively parallel reporter assays, and observed improvements for both tissues. In summary, we compared nine peak callers and devised a superior method for predicting tissue-specific mouse developmental enhancers by reranking the called peaks.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6	3	13	0305-1048	1362-4962		WOS:000456710000011	30137428

Here, we report that distal cis-regulatory elements (CREs) marked by DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) show temporally restricted activities during mouse and human PGC development. Using DHS maps as proxy, we accurately locate the genome-wide binding sites of pluripotency transcription factors in mouse PGCs. Unexpectedly, we found that mouse female meiotic recombination hotspots can be captured by DHSs, and for the first time, we identified 12,211 recombination hotspots in mouse female PGCs. In contrast to that of meiotic female PGCs, the chromatin of mitotic-arrested male PGCs is permissive through nuclear transcription factor Y (NFY) binding in the distal regulatory regions. Furthermore, we examined the evolutionary pressure on PGC CREs, and comparative genomic analysis revealed that mouse and human PGC CREs are evolutionarily conserved and show strong conservation across the vertebrate tree outside the mammals. Therefore, our results reveal unique, temporally accessible chromatin configurations during mouse and human PGC development.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	22	1001-0602	1748-7838		WOS:000449267800007	30305709

However, H1 dynamics and its functions in embryonic development remain unresolved. Here, we profiled gene expression, nucleosome positions, and H1 locations in early Drosophila embryos. The results show that H1 binding is positively correlated with the stability of beads-on-a-string nucleosome organization likely through stabilizing nucleosome positioning and maintaining nucleosome spacing. Strikingly, nucleosomes with H1 placement deviating to the left or the right relative to the dyad shift to the left or the right, respectively, during early Drosophila embryonic development. H1 occupancy on genic nucleosomes is inversely correlated with nucleosome distance to the transcription start sites. This inverse correlation reduces as gene transcription levels decrease. Additionally, H1 occupancy is lower at the 5' border of genic nucleosomes than that at the 3' border. This asymmetrical pattern of H1 occupancy on genic nucleosomes diminishes as gene transcription levels decrease. These findings shed new lights into how H1 placement dynamics correlates with nucleosome positioning and gene transcription during early Drosophila embryonic development.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2	0	3	2041-4889			WOS:000438367000013	29988149

Here, we reported that down-regulation of Sin3a led to the loss of embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and skewed differentiation into mesendoderm lineage. We found that Sin3a functioned as a transcriptional coactivator of the critical Nodal antagonist Lefty1 through interacting with Tet1 to de-methylate the Lefty1 promoter. Further studies showed that two amino acid residues (Phe147, Phe182) in the PAH1 domain of Sin3a are essential for Sin3a-Tet1 interaction and its activity in regulating pluripotency. Furthermore, genome-wide analyses of Sin3a, Tet1 and Pol II ChIP-seq and of 5mC MeDIP-seq revealed that Sin3a acted with Tet1 to facilitate the transcription of a set of their co-target genes. These results link Sin3a to epigenetic DNA modifications in transcriptional activation and have implications for understanding mechanisms underlying versatile functions of Sin3a in mouse ESCs.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10	2	21	0305-1048	1362-4962		WOS:000438397200019	29733394

A better understanding of the factors regulating sympathetic nervous system development is critical to the development of potential therapies. Here, we have uncovered a temporal requirement for the LIM homeodomain transcription factor ISL1 during sympathetic nervous system development by the analysis of two mutant mouse lines: an Isl1 hypomorphic line and mice with Isl1 ablated in neural crest lineages. During early development, ISL1 is required for sympathetic neuronal fate determination, differentiation, and repression of glial differentiation, although it is dispensable for initial noradrenergic differentiation. ISL1 also plays an essential role in sympathetic neuron proliferation by controlling cell cycle gene expression. During later development, ISL1 is required for axon growth and sympathetic neuron diversification by maintaining noradrenergic differentiation, but repressing cholinergic differentiation. RNA-seq analyses of sympathetic ganglia from Isl1 mutant and control embryos, together with ISL1 ChIP-seq analysis on sympathetic ganglia, demonstrated that ISL1 regulates directly or indirectly several distinct signaling pathways that orchestrate sympathetic neurogenesis. A number of genes implicated in neuroblastoma pathogenesis are direct downstream targets of ISL1. Our study revealed a temporal requirement for ISL1 in multiple aspects of sympathetic neuron development, and suggested Isl1 as a candidate gene for neuroblastoma.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6	1	11	2041-4889			WOS:000427410000028	29445148

However, the high incidence of self-diploidization and low efficiency of SC mouse production are major obstacles preventing widespread use of these cells. Moreover, although SC mice generation could be greatly improved by knocking out the differentially methylated regions of two imprinted genes, 50% of the SC mice did not survive into adulthood. Here, we found that the genome-wide DNA methylation level in AG-haESCs is extremely low. Subsequently, downregulation of both de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3b and other methylation-related genes was determined to be responsible for DNA hypomethylation. We further demonstrated that ectopic expression of Dnmt3b in AG-haESCs could effectively improve DNA methylation level, and the high incidence of self-diploidization could be markedly rescued. More importantly, the developmental potential of SC embryos was improved, and most SC mice could survive into adulthood.									4	1	0	0	3	0	4	1	12	2213-6711			WOS:000424907600014	29396184

Chemical iPSCs (C-iPSCs) and OSKM-iPSCs (4F-iPSCs) have been suggested to have similar characteristics to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, their epigenetic equivalence remains incompletely understood throughout the genome. In this study, we have generated mouse C-iPSCs and 4F-iPSCs, and further compared the genome-wide DNA methylomes of C-iPSCs, 4F-iPSCs, and mESCs that were maintained in 2i and LIF. Three pluripotent stem cells tend to be low methylated overall, however, DNA methylations in some specific regions (such as retrotransposons) are cell type-specific. Importantly, C-iPSCs are more hypomethylated than 4F-iPSCs. Bisulfite sequencing indicated that DNA methylation status in several known imprinted clusters, such as: Dlk1-Dio3 and Peg12-Ube3a, in C-iPSCs are closer to those of mESCs than 4F-iPSCs. Overall, our data demonstrate the reprogramming methods-dependent epigenetic differences of C-iPSCs and 4F-iPSCs and reveal that C-iPSCs are more hypomethylated than OSKM-integrated iPSCs.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6	0	9	2041-4889			WOS:000427401400029	29416007

How a cell responds to pHi changes to maintain bioenergetic homeostasis remains elusive. Here we show that Smad5, a well-characterized downstream component of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling responds to pHi changes. Cold, basic or hypertonic conditions increase pHi, which in turn dissociates protons from the charged amino acid clusters within the MH1 domain of Smad5, prompting its relocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. On the other hand, heat, acidic or hypotonic conditions decrease pHi, blocking the nuclear export of Smad5, and thus causing its nuclear accumulation. Active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Smad5 induced by environmental changes and pHi fluctuation is independent of BMP signaling, carboxyl terminus phosphorylation and Smad4. In addition, ablation of Smad5 causes chronic and irreversible dysregulation of cellular bioenergetic homeostasis and disrupted normal neural developmental processes as identified in a differentiation model of human pluripotent stem cells. Importantly, these metabolic and developmental deficits in Smad5-deficient cells could be rescued only by cytoplasmic Smad5. Cytoplasmic Smad5 physically interacts with hexokinase 1 and accelerates glycolysis. Together, our findings indicate that Smad5 acts as a pHi messenger and maintains the bioenergetic homeostasis of cells by regulating cytoplasmic metabolic machinery.									6	1	0	0	6	0	6	4	31	1001-0602	1748-7838		WOS:000408916300005	28675158

However, owing to the instability and heterogeneity of CHO cells, the development of stable and high-expression recombinant CHO cell lines is often time-consuming. To investigate the mechanisms associated with heterogeneity in protein productivity, we performed transcriptome analysis on the subclones derived from a stable parental CHO clone. Two high-expression subclones and one low-expression subclone were selected based on their similar genomic background and subjected to RNA-seq analysis. Over 100 differentially expressed genes were identified between the subclones with high and low productivity. The molecular functions of the differentially expressed genes were enriched for translational elongation, sterol biosynthetic process, and regulation of secretion. In addition, analyses of the two subclones with high protein expression levels identified over 300 differentially expressed genes involved in DNA metabolic processes, cellular macromolecule catabolic processes, cell cycle, protein catabolic processes, and RNA processing and transcription. A subset of the differentially expressed genes was overexpressed in CHO cells to identify their effects on protein production. Together, these results indicate that transcriptome variation can cause significant inter-cellular heterogeneity in CHO cells and a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying heterogeneity might help to improve the production of recombinant proteins by CHO cells.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6	0	9	0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000405181100019	28540426

However, chromatin remodeling and its epigenetic regulatory roles during the differentiation of human neuroectodermal cells (hNECs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) remain largely unexplored. Here, we obtained hNECs through directed differentiation from hESCs, and determined chromatin states in the two cell types. Upon differentiation, H2A.Z-mediated nucleosome depletion leads to an open chromatin structure in promoters and upregulates expression of neuroectodermal genes. Increase in H3K9ac signals and decrease in H3K27me3 signals in promoters result in an active chromatin state and activate neuroectodermal genes. Conversely, decrease in H3K9ac signals and increase in H3K27me3 signals in promoters repress pluripotency genes. Moreover, H3K9ac signals facilitate the pluripotency factor Sox2 binding to target sites unique to hNECs. Knockdown of the acetyltransferase Kat2b erases H3K9ac signals, disrupts Sox2 binding, and fails the differentiation. Our results demonstrate a hierarchy of epigenetic regulation of gene expression during the differentiation of hNECs from hESCs through chromatin remodeling.									5	4	0	0	5	0	7	1	10	1350-9047	1476-5403		WOS:000401701800017	28475175

Chromatin remodeling has a critical role in the differentiation process. However, its in vivo epigenetic regulatory role remains unknown. We show here that nucleosome depletion regions (NDRs) form in both proximal promoters and distal enhancers during NSCs differentiating into neurons in the early Drosophila embryonic development. NDR formation in the regulatory regions involves nucleosome shift and eviction. Nucleosome occupancy in promoter NDRs is inversely proportional to the gene activity. Genes with promoter NDR formation during differentiation are enriched for functions related to neuron development and maturation. Active histone-modification signals (H3K4me3 and H3K9ac) in promoters are gained in neurons in two modes: de novo establishment to high levels or increase from the existing levels in NSCs. The gene sets corresponding to the two modes have different neuronrelated functions. Dynamic changes of H3K27ac and H3K9ac signals in enhancers and promoters synergistically repress genes associated with neural stem or progenitor cell-related pluripotency and upregulate genes associated with neuron projection morphogenesis, neuron differentiation, and so on. Our results offer new insights into chromatin remodeling during in vivo neuron development and lay a foundation for its epigenetic regulatory mechanism study of other lineage specification.									9	1	0	0	9	0	9	0	12	1350-9047	1476-5403		WOS:000395791200003	27858939

However, the pattern and the functions of chromatin remodeling in cell fate transition remain enigmatic. To address this issue, we studied chromatin remodeling in mouse somatic cell reprograming and the differentiation of human embryonic cells (ESC) into neuroectodermal cells (NEC), respectively, and achieved a series of progress. The results show that accurate nucleosome remodeling takes place and results in a chromatin structure in iPSC highly similar to that in ESC. The core pluripotency factor Oct4 plays pivotal roles in somatic reprograming. We depicted the molecular roadmap of dynamic Oct4 binding and key histone modification changes in the course of somatic reprograming, and revealed the functions of their interactions in gain and maintenance of pluripotency. In the process of human ESC differentiating to NEC, we found that nucleosome eviction occurs in the nucleosome depletion regions right upstream of transcription start sites and activates these NEC-related genes. Acetyltransferase KAT2B deposits H3K9ac signal to recruit the transcription factor Sox2 binding to the target sites specific in NEC and activate the target genes, therefore facilitating the differentiation of NEC. These findings greatly improve our understanding of chromatin remodeling in cell fate transition and its associated epigenetic regulatory roles.			染色质重塑是重要的表观遗传调控机制,参与调控许多重要生物过程,但细胞命运转化中染色质变化模式及其调控机制并不清楚。围绕这一问题,江赐忠和高绍荣实验室研究了小鼠体细胞重编程及人胚胎干细胞(ESC)定向分化成神经外胚层细胞(NEC)中染色质重塑及其作用机制,取得一系列前沿性进展:揭示体细胞重编程中发生精确的核小体重塑,使之获得与ESC没有差别的染色质结构;绘制体细胞重编程中核心全能性转录因子Oct4的动态结合靶点与关键组蛋白修饰变化的分子路线图,及其两者互作对全能性获得与维持的调控机制;发现人ESC向NEC分化中,紧挨转录起始位点上游的核小体缺失区发生核小体丢失,激活NEC相关基因,组蛋白乙酰基转移酶KAT2B增加H3K9ac信号来招募转录因子Sox2结合到NEC特异靶点激活靶点基因,促进NEC分化。这些成果极大提高人们对细胞命运转化中染色质重塑及其表观遗传调控机制的认识。						0	0	0		0	0	0	0	1	1004-0374			CSCD:6106874

The role of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) as coreceptors of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the adult heart remain unknown. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 and dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk1) are 2 secreted LRP5/6 binding proteins that play a crucial role in heart development through preventing Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation. However, their roles in the adult heart remain unexplored.METHODS: To understand the role of LRP5/6 and beta-catenin in the adult heart, we constructed conditional cardiomyocyte-specific LRP5/6 and beta-catenin knockout mice and induced surgical myocardial infarction. We also directly injected recombinant proteins of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 and Dkk1 into the heart immediately following myocardial infarction to further examine the mechanisms through which these proteins regulate LRP5/6 and beta-catenin.RESULTS: Deletion of LRP5/6 promoted cardiac ischemic insults. Conversely, deficiency of beta-catenin, a downstream target of LRP5/6, was beneficial in ischemic injury. It is interesting to note that although both insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 and Dkk1 are secreted Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibitors, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 protected the ischemic heart by inhibiting beta-catenin, whereas Dkk1 enhanced the injury response mainly through inducing LRP5/6 endocytosis and degradation.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal previously unidentified dual roles of LRP5/6 involved in the cardiomyocyte response to ischemic injury. These findings suggest new therapeutic strategies in ischemic heart disease by fine-tuning LRP5/6 and beta-catenin signaling within the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.									25	2	0	0	23	0	26	1	21	0009-7322	1524-4539		WOS:000390558300011	27803037

Stable expression of Nanog is essential to maintain the stemness of ESCs. However, Nanog is a short-lived protein and quickly degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome system. Here we report that the deubiquitinase USP21 interacts with, deubiquitinates and stabilizes Nanog, and therefore maintains the protein level of Nanog in mouse ESCs (mESCs). Loss of USP21 results in Nanog degradation, mESCs differentiation and reduces somatic cell reprogramming efficiency. USP21 is a transcriptional target of the LIF/STAT3 pathway and is downregulated upon differentiation. Moreover, differentiation cues promote ERK-mediated phosphorylation and dissociation of USP21 from Nanog, thus leading to Nanog degradation. In addition, USP21 is recruited to gene promoters by Nanog to deubiquitinate histone H2A at K119 and thus facilitates Nanog-mediated gene expression. Together, our findings provide a regulatory mechanism by which extrinsic signals regulate mESC fate via deubiquitinating Nanog.									36	0	0	0	32	0	36	1	27	2041-1723			WOS:000388641000001	27886188

Here, we report that sonic hedgehog-induced ventral neuroprogenitors under EB conditions are fated to medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), while the AD cells mostly adopt a floor-plate (FP) fate. The EB-MGE later on differentiates into GABA and cholinergic neurons, while the AD-FP favors dopaminergic neuron specification. Distinct developmental, metabolic, and adhesion traits in AD and EB cells may potentially account for their differential patterning potency. Gene targeting combined with small-molecule screening experiments identified that concomitant inhibition of Wnts, STAT3, and p38 pathways (3i) could largely convert FP to MGE under AD conditions. Thus, differentiation paradigms and signaling regulators can be integrated together to specify distinct neuronal subtypes for studying and treating related neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.									7	1	0	0	6	0	7	0	14	2213-6711			WOS:000389509000010	27720902

However, the global transcriptional alteration by FMRP deficiency has not been well characterized at single nucleotide resolution, i.e., RNA-seq. Here, we performed in-vitro neuronal differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that were derived from fibroblasts of a FXS patient (FXS-iPSC). We then performed RNA-seq and examined the transcriptional misregulation at each intermediate stage during in-vitro differentiation of FXS-iPSC into neurons. After thoroughly analyzing the transcriptomic data and integrating them with those from other platforms, we found up-regulation of many genes encoding TFs for neuronal differentiation (WNT1, BMP4, POU3F4, TFAP2C, and PAX3), down-regulation of potassium channels (KCNA1, KCNC3, KCNG2, KCNIP4, KCNJ3, KCNK9, and KCNT1) and altered temporal regulation of SHANK1 and NNAT in FXS-iPSC derived neurons, indicating impaired neuronal differentiation and function in FXS patients. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the FMRP deficiency in FXS patients has significant impact on the gene expression patterns during development, which will help to discover potential targeting candidates for the cure of FXS symptoms.									17	3	0	0	17	0	17	0	11	1674-7305	1869-1889		WOS:000387336300001	27730449

However, little is known about the relationship between chromatin remodeling dynamics and in vivo cell lineage commitment. Here, we reveal the patterns of histone modification change and nucleosome positioning dynamics and their epigenetic regulatory roles during the in vivo glial differentiation in early Drosophila embryos. The genome-wide average H3K9ac signals in promoter regions are decreased in the glial cells compared to the neural progenitor cells. However, H3K9ac signals are increased in a group of genes that are up-regulated in glial cells and involved in gliogenesis. There occurs extensive nucleosome remodeling including shift, loss, and gain. Nucleosome depletion regions (NDRs) form in both promoters and enhancers. As a result, the associated genes are up-regulated. Intriguingly, NDRs form in two fashions: nucleosome shift and eviction. Moreover, the mode of NDR formation is independent of the original chromatin state of enhancers in the neural progenitor cells.									4	1	0	0	4	0	4	0	6	2045-2322			WOS:000383644200001	27634414

However, the molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinogenesis remain largely unexplored. In this study, we profiled global gene expression in liver tissues of rats that developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) administration and those that were AFB(1)-resistant, as well as rats without AFB(1) exposure as a control. AFB(1) exposure resulted in extensive perturbation in gene expression with different functions in HCC and AFB(1) resistance (AR) samples. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HCC sample were enriched for cell proliferation, cell adhesion and vasculature development that largely contribute to carcinogenesis. Anti-apoptosis genes were up-regulated in HCC sample whereas apoptosis-induction genes were up-regulated in AR sample. AFB(1) exposure also caused extensive alteration in expression level of lncRNAs. Among all the 4511 annotated lncRNAs, half of them were highly expressed only in HCC sample and up-regulated a group of protein-coding genes with cancer-related functions: apoptosis regulation, DNA repair, and cell cycle. Intriguingly, these genes were down-regulated by lncRNAs highly expressed in AR sample. Collectively, apoptosis is the critical biological process for carcinogenesis in response to AFB(1) exposure through changes in expression level of both protein-coding and lncRNA genes.									11	1	0	0	12	0	14	1	18	2045-2322			WOS:000381706100001	27545718

Our previous study shows that treatment with a VEGF inhibitor (VEGF-Trap) facilitates to develop tumor resistance through regulating angiogenesis-related genes. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Histone modifications as a key epigenetic factor play a critical role in regulation of gene expression. Here, we explore the potential epigenetic gene regulatory functions of key histone modifications during tumor resistance in a mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell line. We generated high resolution genome-wide maps of key histone modifications in sensitive tumor sample (LLC-NR) and resistant tumor sample (LLC-R) after VEGF-Trap treatment. Profiling analysis of histone modifications shows that histone modification levels are effectively predictive for gene expression. Composition of promoters classified by histone modification state is different between LLC-NR and LLC-R cell lines regardless of CpG content. Histone modification state change between LLC-NR and LLC-R cell lines shows different patterns in CpG-rich and CpG-poor promoters. As a consequence, genes with different level of CpG content whose gene expression level are altered are enriched in distinct functions. Notably, histone modification state change in promoters of angiogenesis-related genes consists with their expression alteration. Taken together, our findings suggest that treatment with anti-VEGF therapy results in extensive histone modification state change in promoters with multiple functions, particularly, biological processes related to angiogenesis, likely contributing to tumor resistance development.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3	1	11	1932-6203			WOS:000378865200049	27362259

Intriguingly, TM4SF1 couples the collagen receptor tyrosine kinase DDR1 to the cortical adaptor syntenin 2 and, hence, to PKC alpha. The latter kinase phosphorylates and activates JAK2, leading to the activation of STAT3. This non-canonical mechanism of signaling induces the expression of SOX2 and NANOG; sustains the manifestation of cancer stem cell traits; and drives metastatic reactivation in the lung, bone, and brain. Bioinformatic analyses and pathological studies corroborate the clinical relevance of these findings. We conclude that non-canonical DDR1 signaling enables breast cancer cells to exploit the ubiquitous interstitial matrix component collagen I to undergo metastatic reactivation in multiple target organs.									74	1	0	0	58	0	74	1	35	0092-8674	1097-4172		WOS:000380254400010	27368100

Dysregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling has been implicated in various cancers, but its role in cell death has not yet been fully elucidated. Here we show that activation of Wg signaling induces cell death in Drosophila eyes and wings, which depends on dFoxO, a transcription factor known to be involved in cell death. In addition, dFoxO is required for ectopic and endogenous Wg signaling to regulate wing patterning. Moreover, dFoxO is necessary for activated Wg signaling-induced target genes expression. Furthermore, Arm is reciprocally required for dFoxO-induced cell death. Finally, dFoxO physically interacts with Arm both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we have characterized a previously unknown role of dFoxO in promoting Wg signaling, and that a dFoxO-Arm complex is likely involved in their mutual functions, e.g. cell death.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5	0	15	2045-2322			WOS:000371224900001	26936649

Smad2 and Smad3 are structurally similar and it is mostly considered that they are equally important in mediating TGF beta signals. Here, we show that Smad3 is an insensitive TGF beta transducer as compared with Smad2. Smad3 preferentially localizes within the nucleus and is thus sequestered from membrane signaling. The ability of Smad3 in oligomerization with Smad4 upon agonist stimulation is also impaired given its unique linker region. Smad2 mediated TGF beta signaling plays a crucial role in epiblast development and patterning of three germ layers. However, signaling unrelated nuclear localized Smad3 is dispensable for TGF beta signaling-mediated epiblast specification, but important for early neural development, an event blocked by TGF beta/Smad2 signaling. Both Smad2 and Smad3 bind to the conserved Smads binding element (SBE), but they show nonoverlapped target gene binding specificity and differential transcriptional activity. We conclude that Smad2 and Smad3 possess differential sensitivities in relaying TGF beta signaling and have distinct roles in regulating early developmental events.									33	1	0	0	30	0	34	1	26	2045-2322			WOS:000370861200001	26905010

One of the key features of neuroblastoma is extensive tumor-driven angiogenesis due to hypoxia. However, the mechanism through which neuroblastoma cells drive angiogenesis is poorly understood. Here we show that the long noncoding RNA MALAT1 was upregulated in human neuroblastoma cell lines under hypoxic conditions. Conditioned media from neuroblastoma cells transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting MALAT1, compared with conditioned media from neuroblastoma cells transfected with control siRNAs, induced significantly less endothelial cell migration, invasion and vasculature formation. Microarray-based differential gene expression analysis showed that one of the genes most significantly down-regulated following MALAT1 suppression in human neuroblastoma cells under hypoxic conditions was fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses confirmed that MALAT1 suppression reduced FGF2 expression, and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays revealed that transfection with MALAT1 siRNAs reduced FGF2 protein secretion from neuroblastoma cells. Importantly, addition of recombinant FGF2 protein to the cell culture media reversed the effects of MALAT1 siRNA on vasculature formation. Taken together, our data suggest that up-regulation of MALAT1 expression in human neuroblastoma cells under hypoxic conditions increases FGF2 expression and promotes vasculature formation, and therefore plays an important role in tumor-driven angiogenesis.									62	2	0	0	56	0	64	0	6		1949-2553		WOS:000375618100018	26848616

Here, we profile Oct4 occupancy, epigenetic changes, and gene expression in reprogramming. We find that Oct4 binds in a hierarchical manner to target sites with primed epigenetic modifications. Oct4 binding is temporally continuous and seldom switches between bound and unbound. Oct4 occupancy in most of promoters is maintained throughout the entire reprogramming process. In contrast, somatic cell-specific enhancers are silenced in the early and intermediate stages, whereas stem cell-specific enhancers are activated in the late stage in parallel with cell fate transition. Both epigenetic remodeling and Oct4 binding contribute to the hyperdynamic enhancer signature transitions. The hierarchical Oct4 bindings are associated with distinct functional themes at different stages. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive molecular roadmap of Oct4 binding in concert with epigenetic rearrangements and rich resources for future reprogramming studies.									33	3	0	0	28	0	34	1	15	2211-1247			WOS:000370190400024	26832419

However, the recombinant protein expression level of CHO cells may reduce during long-term culture. The physiological changes related to the stability of expression were not well understood. In this study, we performed a series of genetic analysis on stable and unstable clonal derived populations. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a large number of differentially expressed genes (>100) were identified in the unstable population between early and late generations, while only a few differentially expressed genes were found in the stable population, suggesting that the gene expression change is related to the instability of recombinant protein production. On the other hand, no significant differences were found in promoter methylation or gene copy numbers in the unstable population. Taken together, our data help better understand the molecular mechanism underlying the stability of recombinant protein production in CHO cells.									12	2	0	0	13	0	14	0	23	1742-206X	1742-2051		WOS:000367200100011	26563441

Although naive pluripotent stem cells show much higher levels of self-renewal ability and multidifferentiation capacity, it is unknown whether na ve iPSCs can be generated directly from patient somatic cells and will be superior to primed iPSCs. In the present study, we used an established 5i/L/FA system to directly reprogram fibroblasts of a patient with beta-thalassemia into transgene-free na ve iPSCs with molecular signatures of ground-state pluripotency. Furthermore, these na ve iPSCs can efficiently produce cross-species chimeras. Importantly, using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 nuclease genome editing system, these na ve iPSCs exhibit significantly improved gene-correction efficiencies compared with the corresponding primed iPSCs. Furthermore, human naive iPSCs could be directly generated from noninvasively collected urinary cells, which are easily acquired and thus represent an excellent cell resource for further clinical trials. Therefore, our findings demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of using patient-specific iPSCs in the naive state for disease modeling, gene editing, and future clinical therapy.									35	3	2	0	23	0	39	1	35	2157-6564	2157-6580		WOS:000368752300008	26676643

Here, we determined the genome-wide nucleosome coverage and histone methylation occupancy in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and pre-iPSCs. We found that nucleosome occupancy increases in promoter regions and decreases in intergenic regions in pre-iPSCs, then recovers to an intermediate level in iPSCs. We also found that nucleosomes in pre-iPSCs are much more phased than those in MEFs and iPSCs. During reprogramming, nucleosome reorganization and histone methylation around transcription start sites (TSSs) are highly coordinated with distinctively transcriptional activities. Bivalent promoters gradually increase, while repressive promoters gradually decrease. High CpG (HCG) promoters of active genes are characterized by nucleosome depletion at TSSs, while low CpG (LCG) promoters exhibit the opposite characteristics. In addition, we show that vitamin C (VC) promotes reorganizations of canonical, H3K4me3- and H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes on specific genes during transition from pre-iPSCs to iPSCs. These data demonstrate that pre-iPSCs have a more open and phased chromatin architecture than that of MEFs and iPSCs. Finally, this study reveals the dynamics and critical roles of nucleosome positioning and chromatin organization in gene regulation during reprogramming.									11	1	0	0	11	0	12	1	33	2045-2322			WOS:000365853000001	26639176

However, genetic manipulations raise safety concerns and are thus not desirable in most clinical applications. The discovery of full chemically induced pluripotent stem cells suggest the possibility of replacing transcription factors with chemical cocktails. Here, we report the generation of automatically beating cardiomyocyte-like cells from mouse fibroblasts using only chemical cocktails. These chemical-induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (CiCMs) express cardiomyocyte-specific markers, exhibit sarcomeric organization, and possess typical cardiac calcium flux and electrophysiological features. Genetic lineage tracing confirms the fibroblast origin of these CiCMs. Further studies show the generation of CiCMs passes through a cardiac progenitor stage instead of a pluripotent stage. Bypassing the use of viral-derived factors, this proof of concept study lays a foundation for in vivo cardiac transdifferentiation with pharmacological agents and possibly safer treatment of heart failure.									95	18	0	0	81	0	103	1	56	1001-0602	1748-7838		WOS:000360765600006	26292833

Here, we determined that the LIM homeodomain transcription factor ISL1 plays a key role in survival, proliferation, and function of pacemaker cells throughout development. Analysis of several Isl1 mutant mouse lines, including animals harboring an SAN-specific Isl1 deletion, revealed that ISL1 within SAN is a requirement for early embryonic viability. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of FACS-purified cells from ISL1-deficient SANs revealed that a number of genes critical for SAN function, including those encoding transcription factors and ion channels, were downstream of ISL1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays performed with anti-ISL1 antibodies and chromatin extracts from FACS-purified SAN cells demonstrated that ISL1 directly binds genomic regions within several genes required for normal pacemaker function, including subunits of the L-type calcium channel, Ank2, and Tbx3. Other genes implicated in abnormal heart rhythm in humans were also direct ISL1 targets. Together, our results demonstrate that ISL1 regulates approximately one-third of SAN-specific genes, indicate that a combination of ISL1 and other SAN transcription factors could be utilized to generate pacemaker cells, and suggest ISL1 mutations may underlie sick sinus syndrome.									41	2	0	0	36	0	43	0	33	0021-9738	1558-8238		WOS:000359034800032	26193633

However, the upstream effectors of this pathway have not been clearly defined. Here, we show that periodic tryptophan protein 1 (Pwp1), a WD-40 repeat-containing protein associated with histone H4 modification, is required for the exit of mESCs from the pluripotent state into all lineages. Knockdown (KD) of Pwp1 does not affect mESC proliferation, self-renewal, or apoptosis. However, KD of Pwp1 impairs the differentiation potential of mESCs both in vitro and in vivo. PWP1 chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq results revealed that the PWP1-occupied regions were marked with significant levels of H4K20me3. Moreover, Pwp1 binds to sites in the upstream region of Stat3. KD of Pwp1 decreases the level of H4K20me3 in the upstream region of Stat3 gene and upregulates the expression of Stat3. Furthermore, Pwp1 KD mESCs recover their differentiation potential through suppressing the expression of Stat3 or inhibiting the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3.

Nucleosome remodeling occurs during somatic cell reprogramming, but it is still unclear to what degree the re-established nucleosome organization of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) resembles embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and whether the iPSCs inherit some residual gene expression from the parental fibroblast cells.Results: We generated genome-wide nucleosome maps in mouse ESCs and in iPSCs reprogrammed from somatic cells belonging to three different germ layers using a secondary reprogramming system. Pairwise comparisons showed that the nucleosome organizations in the iPSCs, regardless of the iPSCs' tissue of origin, were nearly identical to the ESCs, but distinct from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). There is a canonical nucleosome arrangement of -1, nucleosome depletion region, + 1, + 2, + 3, and so on nucleosomes around the transcription start sites of active genes whereas only a nucleosome occupies silent transcriptional units. Transcription factor binding sites possessed characteristic nucleosomal architecture, such that their access was governed by the rotational and translational settings of the nucleosome. Interestingly, the tissue-specific genes were highly expressed only in the parental somatic cells of the corresponding iPS cell line before reprogramming, but had a similar expression level in all the resultant iPSCs and ESCs.Conclusions: The re-established nucleosome landscape during nuclear reprogramming provides a conserved setting for accessibility of DNA sequences in mouse pluripotent stem cells. No persistent residual expression program or nucleosome positioning of the parental somatic cells that reflected their tissue of origin was passed on to the resulting mouse iPSCs.									7	2	0	0	7	0	8	1	14	1741-7007			WOS:000348151900001	25528259

Many studies have implied that BPA exposure is harmful to human health. Previous studies mainly focused on BPA effects on estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cells. Genome-wide impacts of BPA on gene expression in ER-negative cells is unclear. In this study, we performed RNA-seq to characterize BPA-induced cellular and molecular impacts on ER-negative HEK293 cells. The microscopic observation showed that low-dose BPA exposure did not affect cell viability and morphology. Gene expression profiling analysis identified a list of differentially expressed genes in response to BPA exposure in HEK293 cells. These genes were involved in variable important biological processes including ion transport, cysteine metabolic process, apoptosis, DNA damage repair, etc. Notably, BPA up-regulated the expression of ERCC5 encoding a DNA endonuclease for nucleotide-excision repair. Further electrochemical experiment showed that BPA induced significant DNA damage in ER-positive MCF-7 cells but not in ER-negative HEK293 cells. Collectively, our study revealed that ER-negative HEK293 cells employed mechanisms in response to BPA exposure different from ER-positive cells.									10	0	2	0	11	0	13	0	26	1932-6203			WOS:000336841400041	24901218

PBDEs have become a global environmental organic pollutant due to the properties of persistence, toxicity, and bioaccumulation. The well-studied toxic effects of PBDEs mainly include thyroid hormone disruption and neurotoxicity. There is no consistent conclusions on the carcinogenic potential of PBDEs to date. Here, we explored the toxic effects of BDE-209 on human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). The comparison of the gene expression profiles of HEK293T cells with BDE-209 treatment and the negative control found that BDE-209 exposure may alter nucleosome organization through significantly changing the expression of histone gene clusters. The remodeled chromatin structure could further disturb systemic lupus erythematosus as one of the toxic effects of BDE-209. Additionally, gene sets of different cancer modules are positively correlated with BDE-209 exposure. This suggests that BDE-209 has carcinogenic potential for a variety of tumors. Collectively, BDE-209 has a broader toxicity not limited to disruption of thyroid hormone-related biological processes. Notably, the toxic effects of BDE-209 dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is not the simply additive effects of BDE-209 and DMSO alone.									13	2	0	0	6	0	15	1	22		1664-8021		WOS:000347056800002	24834073

To gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying resistance to anti-VEGF therapy, we developed a mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell line that is resistant to treatment with a potent VEGF inhibitor, VEGF-Trap, through repeated in vivo selection. We compared the transcriptome profiles of resistant and non-resistant tumor cells using RNA-seq analysis. VEGF-C was significantly up-regulated in resistant tumor cells, as determined by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analyses. Inhibition of VEGF-C in resistant cells suppressed endothelial cell migration in vitro and partially restored sensitivity to VEGF-Trap treatment in vivo. Our findings indicate that tumors may develop resistance to anti-VEGF therapy by activating the VEGF-C pathway. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To explore the molecular genetic consequences of such a niche we subjected human (h) MSCs to a pO(2) of 4 mmHg and analyzed global gene expression and alternative splicing (AS) by genome-exon microarray and RT-qPCR, and phenotype by western blot and immunostaining.Results: Out of 446 genes differentially regulated by >2.5-fold, down-regulated genes outnumbered up-regulated genes by 243:203. Exon analyses revealed 60 hypoxia-regulated AS events with splice indices (SI) >1.0 from 53 genes and a correlation between high SI and degree of transcript regulation. Parallel analyses of a publicly available AS study on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)showed that there was a strong cell-specific component with only 11 genes commonly regulated in hMSCs and HUVECs and 17 common differentially spliced genes. Only 3 genes were differentially responsive to hypoxia at the gene (>2.0) and AS levels in both cell types. Functional assignments revealed unique profiles of gene expression with complex regulation of differentiation, extracellular matrix, intermediate filament and metabolic marker genes. Antioxidant genes, striated muscle genes and insulin/IGF-1 signaling intermediates were down-regulated. There was a coordinate induction of 9 out of 12 acidic keratins that along with other epithelial and cell adhesion markers implies a partial mesenchymal to epithelial transition.Conclusions: We conclude that severe hypoxia confers a quiescent phenotype in hMSCs that is reflected by both the transcriptome profile and gene-specific changes of splicosome actions. The results reveal that severe hypoxia imposes markedly different patterns of gene regulation of MSCs compared with more moderate hypoxia. This is the first study to report hypoxia-regulation of AS in stem/progenitor cells and the first molecular genetic characterization of MSC in a hypoxia-induced quiescent immobile state.									26	0	0	0	20	0	26	0	12	1471-2164			WOS:000335600000001	24758227

EPIGENOMICS				6	1			73	88		10.2217/epi.13.72				FEB 2014	2014	Epigenetics is one of the most rapidly developing fields of biological research. Breakthroughs in several technologies have enabled the possibility of genome-wide epigenetic research, for example the mapping of human genome-wide DNA methylation. In addition, with the development of various high-throughput and high-resolution sequencing technologies, a large number of functional noncoding RNAs have been identified. Massive studies indicated that these functional ncRNA also play an important role in epigenetics. In this review, we gain inspiration from the recent proposal of the ceRNAs hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that miRNAs act as a language of communication. Accordingly, we further deduce that all of epigenetics may functionally acquire such a unique language characteristic. In summary, various epigenetic markers may not only participate in regulating cellular processes, but they may also act as the intracellular language' of communication and are involved in extensive information exchanges within cell.									34	3	0	0	20	1	38	0	24	1750-1911	1750-192X		WOS:000332017100012	24579948

What caused the incongruence remains elusive. In this study, we identified 6845 orthologous genes between seventeen placental mammals. Tree shrews and Primates were monophyletic in the phylogenetic trees derived from the first or/and second codon positions whereas tree shrews and Glires formed a monophyly in the trees derived from the third or all codon positions. The same topology was obtained in the phylogeny inference using the slowly and fast evolving genes, respectively. This incongruence was likely attributed to the fast substitution rate in tree shrews and Glires. Notably, sequence GC content only was not informative to resolve the controversial phylogenetic relationships between tree shrews, Glires, and Primates. Finally, estimation in the confidence of the tree selection strongly supported the phylogenetic affiliation of tree shrews to Primates as a monophyly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In Drosophila, gene Brm encodes the core Brahma complex, the ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF class of chromatin remodelers. Its role in modulating the nucleosome landscape in vivo is unclear. In this study, we knocked down Brm in Drosophila third instar larvae to explore the changes in nucleosome profiles and global gene transcription. The results show that Brm knockdown leads to nucleosome occupancy changes throughout the entire genome with a bias in occupancy decrease. In contrast, the knockdown has limited impacts on nucleosome position shift. The knockdown also alters another important physical property of nucleosome positioning, fuzziness. Nucleosome position shift, gain or loss and fuzziness changes are all enriched in promoter regions. Nucleosome arrays around the 5' ends of genes are reorganized in five patterns as a result of Brm knockdown. Intriguingly, the concomitant changes in the genes adjacent to the Brahma-dependent remodeling regions have important roles in development and morphogenesis. Further analyses reveal abundance of AT-rich motifs for transcription factors in the remodeling regions.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10	0	11	0305-1048	1362-4962		WOS:000343220300023	25081211

Integrin-linked-kinase (ILK) plays important roles in multiple cellular processes and embryogenesis. ILK is expressed in the neural crest, but its role in neural crest and outflow tract morphogenesis remains unknown. Results: We ablated ILK specifically in the neural crest using the Wnt1-Cre transgene. ILK ablation resulted in abnormal migration and overpopulation of neural crest cells in the pharyngeal arches and outflow tract and a significant reduction in the expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and extracellular matrix components. ILK mutant embryos exhibited an enlarged common arterial trunk and ventricular septal defect. Reduced smooth muscle differentiation, but increased ossification and neurogenesis/innervation were observed in ILK mutant outflow tract that may partly be due to reduced transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF beta 2) but increased bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Consistent with these observations, microarray analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted neural crest cells revealed reduced expression of genes associated with muscle differentiation, but increased expression of genes of neurogenesis and osteogenesis. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that ILK plays essential roles in neural crest and outflow tract development by mediating complex crosstalk between cell matrix and multiple signaling pathways. Changes in these pathways may collectively result in the unique neural crest and outflow tract phenotypes observed in ILK mutants.									14	1	0	0	11	0	15	1	23	1741-7007			WOS:000328400200001	24131868

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in ADSC for tissue engineering applications. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of ADSC proliferation are not fully understood. Here we show that 47 transcripts are up-regulated while 23 are down-regulated in ADSC compared to terminally differentiated cells based on global mRNA profiling and microRNA profiling. Among the up-regulated genes, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is fine-tuned by miR-199a-5p. Further investigation indicates that VEGF accelerates ADSC proliferation whereas the multipotency of ADSC remains stable in terms of adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic potentials after VEGF treatment, suggesting that VEGF may serve as an excellent supplement for accelerating ADSC proliferation during in vitro expansion.									21	2	0	0	18	0	23	0	19	1932-6203			WOS:000325483600002	24098328

It has been shown that CTCF facilitates the recruitment of the upstream binding factor onto ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and regulates the local epigenetic state of rDNA repeats. However, the mechanism by which CTCF modulates rRNA gene transcription has not been well understood. Here we found that wild-type CTCF augments the pre-rRNA level, cell size, and cell growth in cervical cancer cells. In contrast, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of CTCF reduced pre-rRNA transcription. CTCF positively regulates rRNA gene transcription in a RNA polymerase I-dependent manner. We identified an RRGR motif as a putative nucleolar localization sequence in the C-terminal region of CTCF that is required for activating rRNA gene transcription. Using mass spectrometry, we identified SMC2 and SMC4, two subunits of condensin complexes that interact with CTCF. Condensin negatively regulates CTCF-mediated rRNA gene transcription. Knockdown of SMC2 expression significantly facilitates the loading of CTCF and the upstream binding factor onto the rDNA locus and increases histone acetylation across the rDNA locus. Taken together, our study suggests that condensin competes with CTCF in binding to a specific rDNA locus and negatively regulates CTCF-mediated rRNA gene transcription.									32	0	0	0	33	0	33	0	19		1083-351X		WOS:000330623300036	23884423

The change of histone modification (hyper or hypo) and the corresponding gene expression change (up or down) are also indicated.

Moreover, the prostate-related ENCODE tracks (DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodelers), and other key transcription factors with reported roles in prostate are displayed in the browser as well. The reversibility of epigenetic aberrations has made them potential markers for diagnosis and prognosis, and targets for treatment of cancers. This curated information will improve our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation in prostate cancer, and serve as an important resource for epigenetic research in prostate cancer.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8	0	3	1932-6203			WOS:000319081900081	23696878

H2A.Z nucleosome is extensively involved in gene transcription activation and regulation. To test whether H2A.Z nucleosome has the similar impact on sequence variability in the Drosophila genome, we profiled the H2A.Z nucleosome occupancy and sequence variation rate at gene ends and splicing sites. Consistent with previous studies, H2A.Z nucleosome positioning helps to demarcate the borders of exons. Nucleosome occupancy is anticorrelated with sequence divergence rate in the regions flanking transcription start sites and splicing sites. However, there is no rate heterogeneity between the linker DNA and H2A.Z nucleosomal DNA regardless of nucleosome occupancy, fuzziness, positioning in promoter, coding, and intergenic regions, young or old genes. But the rate at intergenic nucleosomes and the flanking linker regions is higher than that at the genic counterparts. Further analyses found that the high sequence divergence rate in the promoter regions that are usually nucleosome depleted regions may be likely resulted from the high mutation rate in the enriched tandem repeats. Interestingly, within nucleosomes spanning splicing sites, sequence variability of nucleosomal DNA significantly increases from the end within exons to the other end protruding into introns. The relaxed functional constraint in introns contributes to the high rate of nucleosomal DNA residing in introns while the strict functional constraint in exons maintains the low rate of nucleosomal DNA residing in exons. Taken together, H2A.Z nucleosome occupancy has no effect on sequence variability of Drosophila genome, which is likely determined by local sequence composition and the concomitant selection pressure.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	6	1932-6203			WOS:000315637900120	23472174

Recent studies have revealed the important roles of the single flagellum of T. brucei in many aspects, especially that the flagellar motility is required for the viability of the bloodstream form T. brucei, suggesting that impairment of the flagellar function may provide a promising cure for African sleeping sickness. Knowing the flagellum proteome is crucial to study the molecular mechanism of the flagellar functions. Here we present a novel computational method for identifying flagellar proteins in T. brucei, called trypanosome flagellar protein predictor (TFPP). TFPP was developed based on a list of selected discriminating features derived from protein sequences, and could predict flagellar proteins with similar to 92% specificity at a similar to 84% sensitivity rate. Applied to the whole T. brucei proteome, TFPP reveals 811 more flagellar proteins with high confidence, suggesting that the flagellar proteome covers similar to 10% of the whole proteome. Comparison of the expression profiles of the whole T. brucei proteome at three typical life cycle stages found that similar to 45% of the flagellar proteins were significantly changed in expression levels between the three life cycle stages, indicating life cycle stage-specific regulation of flagellar functions in T. brucei. Overall, our study demonstrated that TFPP is highly effective in identifying flagellar proteins and could provide opportunities to study the trypanosome flagellar proteome systematically. Furthermore, the web server for TFPP can be freely accessed at http:/wukong.tongji.edu.cn/tfpp.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	19	1932-6203			WOS:000313738900033	23349782

Here, we report that Sox2 directly regulates endogenous microRNA-29b (miR-29b) expression during iPSC generation and that miR-29b expression is required for OSKM- and OSK-mediated reprogramming. Mechanistic studies show that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are in vivo targets of miR-29b and that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b expression is inversely correlated with miR-29b expression during reprogramming. Moreover, the effect of miR-29b on reprogramming can be blocked by Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b overexpression. Further experiments indicate that miR-29b-DNMT signaling is significantly involved in the regulation of DNA methylation-related reprogramming events, such as mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and Dlk1-Dio3 region transcription. Thus, our studies not only reveal that miR-29b is a novel mediator of reprogramming factor Sox2 but also provide evidence for a multistep mechanism in which Sox2 drives a miR-29b-DNMT signaling axis that regulates DNA methylation-related events during reprogramming.									63	3	0	0	60	0	64	0	35	1001-0602	1748-7838		WOS:000313194700017	23266889

Mouse testes express a large number of miRNAs. However, the physiological roles of these testicular miRNAs remain largely unknown. Using microarray and quantitative real time PCR assays, we identified that miRNAs of the microRNA-449 (miR-449) cluster were preferentially expressed in the mouse testis, and their levels were drastically up-regulated upon meiotic initiation during testicular development and in adult spermatogenesis. The expression pattern of the miR-449 cluster resembled that of microRNA-34b/c (miR-34b/c) during spermatogenesis. Further analyses identified that cAMP-responsive element modulator tau and SOX5, two transcription factors essential for regulating male germ cell gene expression, acted as the upstream transactivators to stimulate the expression of the miR-449 cluster in mouse testes. Despite its abundant expression in testicular germ cells, miR-449-null male mice developed normally and exhibited normal spermatogenesis and fertility. Our data further demonstrated that miR-449 shared a cohort of target genes that belong to the E2F transcription factor-retinoblastoma protein pathway with the miR-34 family, and levels of miR-34b/c were significantly up-regulated in miR-449-null testes. Taken together, our data suggest that the miR-449 cluster and miR-34b/c function redundantly in the regulation of male germ cell development in murine testes.									116	15	0	0	102	1	128	1	16		1083-351X		WOS:000306418600011	22570483

It is situated in a deep branch in the evolutionary tree and is particularly noteworthy in having a very A/T-rich genome. Dictyostelium provides an ideal system to examine the extreme to which nucleotide bias may be employed in organizing promoters, genes, and nucleosomes across a genome. We find that Dictyostelium genes are demarcated precisely at their 5' ends by poly-T tracts and precisely at their 3' ends by poly-A tracts. These tracts are also associated with nucleosome-free regions and are embedded with precisely positioned TATA boxes. Homo- and heteropolymeric tracts of A and T demarcate nucleosome border regions. Together, these findings reveal the presence of a variety of functionally distinct polymeric A/T elements. Strikingly, Dictyostelium chromatin may be organized in di-nucleosome units but is otherwise organized as in animals. This includes a +1 nucleosome in a position that predicts the presence of a paused RNA polymerase II. Indeed, we find a strong phylogenetic relationship between the presence of the NELF pausing factor and positioning of the +1 nucleosome. Pausing and +1 nucleosome positioning may have coevolved in animals.									22	0	0	0	22	0	23	0	7	1088-9051			WOS:000304728100011	22434426

Yet their interrelationships have not been investigated on a comprehensive scale. Here we determined the genome-wide binding locations of 200 transcription-related proteins, under normal and acute heat-shock conditions. This study distinguishes binding between distal versus proximal promoter regions as well as the 3' ends of genes for nearly all mRNA and tRNA genes. This study reveals (1) a greater diversity and specialization of regulation associated with the SAGA transcription pathway compared to the TFIID pathway, (2) new regulators enriched at tRNA genes, (3) a global co-occupancy network of >20,000 unique regulator combinations that show a high degree of regulatory interconnections among lowly expressed genes, (4) regulators of the SAGA pathway located largely distal to the core promoter and regulators of the TFIID pathway located proximally, and (5) distinct mobilization of SAGA- versus TFIID-linked regulators during acute heat shock.									183	1	0	0	181	0	187	0	15	1097-2765	1097-4164		WOS:000287773300012	21329885

So far, investigators have often examined mutation patterns at either interspecies fixed substitution or intraspecies nucleotide polymorphism level, but not both. Here, we performed a unique analysis of a combined set of intra-species polymorphisms and inter-species substitutions in human codons. Strong difference in mutational pattern was found at codon positions 1, 2, and 3 between the polymorphism and fixation data. Fixation had strong bias towards increasing the rarest codons but decreasing the most frequently used codons, suggesting that codon equilibrium has not been reached yet. We detected strong CpG effect on CG-containing codons and subsequent suppression by fixation. Finally, we detected the signature of purifying selection against A vertical bar U dinucleotides at synonymous dicodon boundaries. Overall, fixation process could effectively and quickly correct the volatile changes introduced by polymorphisms so that codon changes could be gradual and directional and that codon composition could be kept relatively stable during evolution.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2	0	2	1110-7243			WOS:000279771500001	20622912

Whether gene regulatory proteins that interact with nucleosomes are selective for individual nucleosome positions across the genome is not known. Here, we examine on a genomic scale several protein-nucleosome interactions, including those that (1) bind histones (Bdf1/SWR1 and Srm1), (2) bind specific DNA sequences (Rap1 and Reb1), and (3) potentially collide with nucleosomes during transcription (RNA polymerase 11). We find that the Bdf1/SWR1 complex forms a dinucleosome complex that is selective for the +1 and +2 nucleosomes of active genes. Rap1 selectively binds to its cognate site on the rotationally exposed first and second helical turn of nucleosomal DNA. We find that a transcribing RNA polymerase creates a delocalized state of resident nucleosomes. These findings suggest that nucleosomes around promoter regions have position-specific functions and that some gene regulators have position-specific nucleosomal interactions.									83	0	0	0	80	0	84	0	5	1097-2765	1097-4164		WOS:000270559100021	19782036

How nucleosomal organization is specified by the genome is less clear. Here we establish and inter-relate rules governing genomic nucleosome organization by sequencing DNA from more than one million immunopurified S. cerevisiae nucleosomes ( displayed at http://atlas.bx.psu.edu/). Evidence is presented that the organization of nucleosomes throughout genes is largely a consequence of statistical packing principles. The genomic sequence specifies the location of the -1 and +1 nucleosomes. The +1 nucleosome forms a barrier against which nucleosomes are packed, resulting in uniform positioning, which decays at farther distances from the barrier. We present evidence for a novel 3' NFR that is present at > 95% of all genes. 3' NFRs may be important for transcription termination and anti-sense initiation. We present a high-resolution genome-wide map of TFIIB locations that implicates 3' NFRs in gene looping.									469	7	0	0	438	0	476	0	29	1088-9051	1549-5469		WOS:000257249100007	18550805

Here we produce a high-resolution reference map of H2A.Z and bulk nucleosome locations across the genome of the fly Drosophila melanogaster and compare it to that from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Like Saccharomyces, Drosophila nucleosomes are organized around active transcription start sites in a canonical -1, nucleosome-free region, +1 arrangement. However, Drosophila does not incorporate H2A.Z into the -1 nucleosome and does not bury its transcriptional start site in the +1 nucleosome. At thousands of genes, RNA polymerase II engages the +1 nucleosome and pauses. How the transcription initiation machinery contends with the +1 nucleosome seems to be fundamentally different across major eukaryotic lines.									497	17	3	0	469	0	511	1	28	0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000255868400044	18408708

However, the relation between polymorphisms of these metabolism genes and AD in Caucasian subjects has not been clearly established. The present study examined evidence for the association of alcohol metabolism genes with AD in the Irish Affected Sib Pair Study of alcohol dependence.Methods: We conducted a case-control association study with 575 independent subjects who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, AD diagnosis and 530 controls. A total of 77 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the seven ADH (ADH1-7) and two ALDH genes (ALDH1A1 and ALDH2) were genotyped using the Illumina GoldenGate protocols. Several statistical procedures were implemented to control for false discoveries.Results: All markers with minor allele frequency greater than 0.01 were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Numerous SNPs in ADH genes showed association with AD, including one marker in the coding region of ADH1C (rs1693482 in exon6, Ile271Gln). Haplotypic association was observed in the ADH5 and ADH1C genes, and in a long haplotype block formed by the ADH1A and ADH1B loci. We detected two significant interactions between pairs of markers in intron 6 of ADH6 and intron 12 of ALDH2 (p = 5 x 10(-5)), and 5' of both ADH4 and A DH1A (p = 2 x 10(-4)).Conclusion: We found evidence for the association of several ADH genes with AD in a sample of Western European origin. The significant interaction effects between markers in ADH and ALDH genes suggest possible epistatic roles between alcohol metabolic enzymes in the risk for AD.									69	1	0	0	57	1	71	0	13	0145-6008			WOS:000255598000011	18331377

NELF causes Pol II to pause in the promoter-proximal region of the hsp70 gene in Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, genome-wide location analysis (chromatin immunoprecipitation-microarray chip [ChIP-chip] analysis) revealed that NELF is concentrated at the 5' ends of 2,111 genes in Drosophila cells. Permanganate genomic footprinting was used to determine if paused Pol II colocalized with NELF. Forty-six of 56 genes with NELF were found to have paused Pol II. Pol 11 pauses 30 to 50 nucleotides downstream from transcription start sites. Analysis of DNA sequences in the vicinity of paused Pol II identified a conserved DNA sequence that probably associates with TFIID but detected no evidence of RNA secondary structures or other conserved sequences that might directly control elongation. ChIP-chip experiments indicate that GAGA factor associates with 39% of the genes that have NELF. Surprisingly, NELF associates with almost one-half of the most highly expressed genes, indicating that NELF is not necessarily a repressor of gene expression. NELF-associated pausing of Pol H might be an obligatory but sometimes transient checkpoint during the transcription cycle.									145	0	3	0	141	0	149	1	10	0270-7306	1098-5549		WOS:000255600800018	18332113

In this study, we investigated the distribution of CGIs in the promoter regions of 3,197 human-mouse orthologous gene pairs and found that the mouse genome has notably fewer CGIs in the promoter regions and less pronounced CGI characteristics than does the human genome. We further inferred CGI's ancestral state using the dog genome as a reference and examined the nucleotide substitution pattern and the mutational direction in the conserved regions of human and mouse CGIs. The results reveal many losses of CGIs in both genomes but the loss rate in the mouse lineage is two to four times the rate in the human lineage. We found an intriguing feature of CGI loss, namely that the loss of a CGI usually starts from erosion at the both edges and gradually moves towards the center. We found functional bias in the genes that have lost promoter-associated CGIs in the human or mouse lineage. Finally, our analysis indicates that the association of CGIs with housekeeping genes is not as strong as previously estimated. Our study provides a detailed view of the evolution of promoter-associated CGIs in the human and mouse genomes and our findings are helpful for understanding the evolution of mammalian genomes and the role of CGIs in gene function.									34	1	0	0	30	0	35	0	4	0737-4038	1537-1719		WOS:000249587200010	17591602

They concluded that 5(m)C deamination rates were highly dependent on local GC content but not on local sequence lengths over which GC content was calculated or the genomic regions where the mutations occurred. Here, we reexamined these statements by using 292,216 CpG -> TpG/CpA and GpC -> GpT/ApC mutations, an increase of 66 times as much data. Contrary to Fryxell and Moon's conclusions, our analysis indicated that 5(m)C deamination rates in the human genome were dependent on both the local sequence length and the genomic region. Some explanations for their conclusions were provided.									29	2	0	0	25	0	29	0	1	0737-4038			WOS:000243069700006	17056644	
J	Seo, Daekwan; Jiang, Cizhong; Zhao, Zhongming								A novel statistical method to estimate the effective SNP size in vertebrate genomes and categorized genomic regions								BMC GENOMICS				7						329	10.1186/1471-2164-7-329				DEC 29 2006	2006	Background: The local environment of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) contains abundant genetic information for the study of mechanisms of mutation, genome evolution, and causes of diseases. Recent studies revealed that neighboring-nucleotide biases on SNPs were strong and the genome-wide bias patterns could be represented by a small subset of the total SNPs. It remains unsolved for the estimation of the effective SNP size, the number of SNPs that are sufficient to represent the bias patterns observed from the whole SNP data.Results: To estimate the effective SNP size, we developed a novel statistical method, SNPKS, which considers both the statistical and biological significances. SNPKS consists of two major steps: to obtain an initial effective size by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS test) and to find an intermediate effective size by interval evaluation. The SNPKS algorithm was implemented in computer programs and applied to the real SNP data. The effective SNP size was estimated to be 38,200, 39,300, 38,000, and 38,700 in the human, chimpanzee, dog, and mouse genomes, respectively, and 39,100, 39,600, 39,200, and 42,200 in human intergenic, genic, intronic, and CpG island regions, respectively.Conclusion: SNPKS is the first statistical method to estimate the effective SNP size. It runs efficiently and greatly outperforms the algorithm implemented in SNPNB. The application of SNPKS to the real SNP data revealed the similar small effective SNP size (38,000-42,200) in the human, chimpanzee, dog, and mouse genomes as well as in human genomic regions. The findings suggest strong influence of genetic factors across vertebrate genomes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1471-2164			WOS:000243512900001	17196097

Previous studies of mutation direction were largely based on substitution data from a limited number of loci. To date, there is no genome-wide analysis of mutation direction or methylation-dependent transition rates in the chimpanzee or its categorized genomic regions.Results: In this study, we performed a detailed examination of mutation direction in the chimpanzee genome and its categorized genomic regions using 588,918 SNPs whose ancestral alleles could be inferred by mapping them to human genome sequences. The C. T ( G. A) changes occurred most frequently in the chimpanzee genome. Each type of transition occurred approximately four times more frequently than each type of transversion. Notably, the frequency of C -> T (G -> A) was the highest in exons among the genomic categories regardless of whether we calculated directly, normalized with the nucleotide content, or removed the SNPs involved in the CpG effect. Moreover, the directionality of the point mutation in exons and CpG islands were opposite relative to their corresponding intergenic regions, indicating that different forces govern the nucleotide changes. Our analysis suggests that the GC content is not in equilibrium in the chimpanzee genome. Further quantitative analysis revealed that the 5-methylcytosine deamination rates at CpG sites were highly dependent on the local GC content and the lengths of SNP flanking sequences and varied among categorized genomic regions.Conclusion: We present the first mutational spectrum, estimated by three different approaches, in the chimpanzee genome. Our results provide detailed information on recent nucleotide changes and methylation-dependent transition rates in the chimpanzee genome after its split from the human. These results have important implications for understanding genome composition evolution, mechanisms of point mutation, and other genetic factors such as selection, biased codon usage, biased gene conversion, and recombination.									16	0	0	0	15	0	16	0	1	1471-2164			WOS:000243332800003	17166280

In this study, we systematically examined the directionality of the point mutations and maintenance of GC content in the human genome using similar to 1.8 million high-quality human single nucleotide polymorphisms and their ancestral sequences in chimpanzees. The frequency of C -> T (G -> A) changes was the highest among all mutation types and the frequency of each type of transition was approximately fourfold that of each type of transversion. In intergenic regions, when the GC content increased, the frequency of changes from G or C increased. In exons, the frequency of G:C -> A:T was the highest among the genomic categories and contributed mainly by the frequent mutations at the CpG sites. In contrast, mutations at the CpG sites, or CpG -> TpG/CpA mutations, occurred less frequently in the CpG islands relative to intergenic regions with similar GC content. Our results suggest that the GC content is overall not in equilibrium in the human genome, with a trend toward shifting the human genome to be AT rich and shifting the GC content of a region to approach the genome average. Our results, which differ from previous estimates based on limited loci or on the rodent lineage, provide the first representative and reliable mutational spectrum in the recent human genome and categorized genomic regions.

The two duplicated gene copies, y1 and y2 are separated by a 9.084 kbp intergenic region, which is largely composed of highly repetitive sequences. The y1 is the functional copy, while the y2 may represent a pseudogene; there are several sequence indels and rearrangements within the putative coding region of y2. The y1 gene encodes a R2R3 type of Myb domain protein that regulates the expression of chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase and dihydroflavonol reductase genes required for the biosynthesis of 3-deoxyflavonoids. Expression of y1 can be observed throughout the plant and it represents a combination of expression patterns produced by different alleles of the maize p1. Comparative sequence analysis within the coding regions and flanking sequences of y1, y2 and their maize and teosinte orthologs show local rearrangements and insertions that may have created modified regulatory regions. These micro-colinearity modifications possibly are responsible for differential patterns of expression in maize and sorghum floral and vegetative tissues. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that sorghum y1 and y2 sequences may have arisen by gene duplication mechanisms and represent an evolutionarily parallel event to the duplication of maize p2 and p1 genes.									23	4	0	0	22	0	27	0	4	0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:000234808900003	16429259	
J	Jiang, CH; Gu, JY; Chopra, S; Gu, X; Peterson, T								Ordered origin of the typical two- and three-repeat Myb genes								GENE				326				13	22		10.1016/j.gene.2003.09.049				FEB 4 2004	2004	Myb domain proteins contain a conserved DNA-binding domain composed of one to four conserved repeat motifs. In animals, Myb proteins are encoded by a small gene family and commonly contain three repeat motifs (R1R2R3); whereas, plant Myb proteins are encoded by a very large and diverse gene family in which a motif containing two repeats (R2R3) is the most common. In contrast to the conservation in the Myb domain, other regions of Myb proteins are highly variable. To explore the evolutionary origin of Myb genes, we cloned and sequenced Myb domains from maize and sorghum, and conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Myb genes. The results indicate that the origins of individual Myb repeats are strikingly distinct, and that the R2 repeat has evolved more slowly than the R1 and R3 repeats. However, it is not clear which repeat is the most ancient one. The evidence also suggests that R2R3 and R1R2R3 Myb genes co-existed in eukaryotes before the divergence of plants and animals. Based on our results, we propose that R1R2R3 Myb genes were derived from R2R3 Myb genes by gain of the R1 repeat through an ancient intragenic duplication; this gain model is more parsimonious than the previous proposal that R2R3 Myb genes were derived from R1R2R3 Mybs by loss of the R1 repeat. A separate group of diverse non-typical Myb proteins exhibits a polyphyletic origin and a complex evolutionary pattern. Finally, a small group of ancient Myb paralogs prior to the amplification of current Myb genes is identified. Together, these results support a new model for the ordered evolution of Myb gene family.

J	Jiang, CZ; Gu, X; Peterson, T								Identification of conserved gene structures and carboxy-terminal motifs in the Myb gene family of Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa L. ssp indica								GENOME BIOLOGY				5	7					R46	10.1186/gb-2004-5-7-r46				2004	2004	Background: Myb proteins contain a conserved DNA-binding domain composed of one to four repeat motifs ( referred to as R0R1R2R3); each repeat is approximately 50 amino acids in length, with regularly spaced tryptophan residues. Although the Myb proteins comprise one of the largest families of transcription factors in plants, little is known about the functions of most Myb genes. Here we use computational techniques to classify Myb genes on the basis of sequence similarity and gene structure, and to identify possible functional relationships among subgroups of Myb genes from Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica). Results: This study analyzed 130 Myb genes from Arabidopsis and 85 from rice. The collected Myb proteins were clustered into subgroups based on sequence similarity and phylogeny. Interestingly, the exon-intron structure differed between subgroups, but was conserved in the same subgroup. Moreover, the Myb domains contained a significant excess of phase 1 and 2 introns, as well as an excess of nonsymmetric exons. Conserved motifs were detected in carboxy-terminal coding regions of Myb genes within subgroups. In contrast, no common regulatory motifs were identified in the noncoding regions. Additionally, some Myb genes with similar functions were clustered in the same subgroups. Conclusions: The distribution of introns in the phylogenetic tree suggests that Myb domains originally were compact in size; introns were inserted and the splicing sites conserved during evolution. Conserved motifs identified in the carboxy-terminal regions are specific for Myb genes, and the identified Myb gene subgroups may reflect functional conservation.									99	3	0	0	91	0	106	1	20	1474-760X			WOS:000222429500011	15239831	
J	Jiang, CZ; Song, WQ; Li, XL; Chen, RY								Studies on microdissection and microcloning of the rye chromosome 1R								ACTA BOTANICA SINICA				40	11			988	993						1998	1998	Two 1R chromosomes of Secale cereale L. were isolated from one metaphase cell by means of chromosome micro-isolation, and the chromosomal DNA was amplified adopting the cohesive adapters single primer polymerase chain reaction (CASP-PCR) technique. The CASP-PCR products were labeled as probes. The results of Southern blot hybridization confirmed that the CBSP-PCR products derived from the chromosome 1R were homologous with the genomic DNA of S. cereale. The clones of PCR products were obtained with high efficiency. Over 10 000 recombinant clones were obtained from one-tenth of the ligation mixture which was transferred into the competent E. coli DH5 alpha. The size of the inserted fragments of clones ranged from 250 bp to 500 bp. This research has established the foundation for further selection of chromosome IR markers.									3	1	0	0	3	0	3	0	2	0577-7496			WOS:000077383800002
